## 4.D.1 IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting ##

### Hardware vs. Logical Addressing: The Layered Defense ###

Network communication fundamentally relies on two distinct addressing schemes, residing in different layers of the OSI model:

| Addressing Type            | OSI Layer               | Example                   | Purpose (CISSP Relevance)                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware Address (MAC)**  | Data-Link (Layer 2)      | 48-bit hex (00:43:AB:F2:32:13) | Uniquely identifies a host within a local network. It lacks hierarchy and cannot create boundaries between separate networks. |
| **Logical Address (IPv4)**  | Network (Layer 3)        | 32-bit decimal (192.168.1.1)   | Provides a hierarchical structure to separate networks and identify the host on that specific network. This hierarchy is essential for routing and segmentation. |

The critical distinction is the lack of hierarchy in MAC addresses. If only Layer-2 addressing existed, the entire internet would collapse under a single broadcast domain. 
It is the logical, hierarchical structure of Internet Protocol (IP) that enables routing and allows us to separate secure zones from unsecure ones, thereby mitigating massive network-wide broadcast storms and enabling scalability.

### The IPv4 Structure: A 32-Bit Constraint ###

IPv4 utilizes a 32-bit address, limiting the total number of possible addresses to just over 4.2 billion (4,294,967,296). This limitation is the primary driver for efficient addressing schemes like subnetting and the eventual migration to IPv6

The 32-bit address is expressed as four 8-bit octets (or bytes) separated by periods. Each octet can range from 0 (00000000 in binary) to 255 (11111111 in binary).

Understanding the math of addresses requires mastery of binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversion, as networking devices operate solely on the binary representation.

### Classful Addressing and Legacy Security ###

Before the advent of modern Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), network architects relied on the concept of address classes, which defined the boundary between the Network ID and Host ID by default.

| Class | First Octet Range | Leading Bit Pattern | Default Subnet Mask | Usable Network Bits           | Private Address Space (RFC 1918)              |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **A**  | 1 – 127           | 0                  | 255.0.0.0           | First Octet (8 bits)           | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255                    |
| **B**  | 128 – 191         | 10                 | 255.255.0.0         | First Two Octets (16 bits)     | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255                  |
| **C**  | 192 – 223         | 110                | 255.255.255.0       | First Three Octets (24 bits)   | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255                |
| **D**  | 224 – 239         | 1110               | Reserved for Multicast | N/A                         | N/A                                          |
| **E**  | 240 – 255         | 1111               | Reserved for Experimental | N/A                      | N/A                                          |

### The Security Relevance of Private Address Space ###

The Private Address Spaces (RFC 1918 addresses) are non-routable on the public internet. This offers a fundamental layer of security:

- Network Address Translation (NAT): Devices use a smaller pool of public addresses to communicate externally, conserving public IP space and hiding internal topology.

- Default Security Posture: Private addresses cannot be directly accessed from the internet, acting as a default perimeter defense and simplifying firewall rules.

### The Subnet Mask and the Crucial ANDing Process ###

The Subnet Mask is the gatekeeper of network intelligence; it determines whether a destination is local or remote. This is a vital security function, as local communication bypasses the router and its security controls (ACLs, Firewalls)

**A subnet mask must be contiguous  and follows two simple, absolute rules:**

1. A binary bit set to 1 in the mask means the corresponding bit in the IP address is part of the Network ID.

2. A binary bit set to 0 in the mask means the corresponding bit in the IP address is part of the Host ID

**The ANDing Equation: The Core of Network Logic:**

Your computer (or a router) determines a host's network address by performing a logical AND operation between the IP Address and the Subnet Mask in binary.


The rules for the AND operation are:

- 1 AND 1 = 1 
- 1 AND 0 = 0 
- 0 AND 1 = 0 
- 0 AND 0 = 0

For example determining the Network Address (Default Mask) of a computer with IP 192.100.10.33 and default Class C mask 255.255.255.0 wants to communicate:

| Component        | Decimal Representation | Binary Representation                    |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **IP Address**   | 192.100.10.33          | 11000000.01100100.00001010.00100001       |
| **Default Mask** | 255.255.255.0          | 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000       |
| **AND Result**   | 192.100.10.0           | 11000000.01100100.00001010.00000000       |

The AND result, 192.100.10.0, is the network address. Any host with this same network address (after ANDing its own IP/Mask) is on the same logical network and can communicate directly. Any host with a different network address requires a router to forward the packet.

### Subnetting: The Security and Efficiency Imperative ###

Subnetting is the practice of dividing a large logical network into smaller, independent sub-networks. This is achieved by using a Custom Subnet Mask that borrows bits from the Host portion of the address and assigns them to the Network portion

Subnetting is not merely a networking optimization; it is a critical security control:

- Network Segmentation: By dividing a large network (e.g., a Class B network) into many smaller subnets, you can separate different departments (Finance, HR, R&D) or functional areas (servers, workstations, IoT devices). This is the foundation of the Zero Trust model and limits the blast radius of any security breach.

- Broadcast Domain Reduction: Smaller subnets mean smaller broadcast domains, which limits unnecessary traffic and conserves bandwidth, enhancing overall performance and security.

- Access Control: Routers, which separate these subnets, can enforce granular security policies (Access Control Lists or Firewall Rules) that would be impossible within a single large network. For example, preventing the Workstation subnet from communicating directly with the Server subnet except on specific ports.

- Address Efficiency (VLSM/CIDR): Variable-Length Subnet Masks (VLSM) and CIDR allow for the use of subnets of different sizes to match the exact host requirements of each sub-network, minimizing wasted IP addresses.

Consider a Class C network address: 192.10.10.0 (Default Mask: 255.255.255.0). 

To create smaller subnets, we borrow bits from the final (Host) octet.

If we borrow 4 bits from the host portion, the custom subnet mask becomes:

- Original Host Octet: 00000000 (binary)
- New Subnet Mask Octet (4 bits borrowed): 11110000
- (binary)Decimal Value: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
- Custom Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240

This borrowing fundamentally changes the logical map of the network:

- Total Subnets: The 4 borrowed bits give 2^4 subnets. ( 2^4 = 16 total subnets) 
- Usable Hosts per Subnet: The remaining 4 host bits give $2^4 - 2 usable addresses (Network and Broadcast addresses are reserved). ( 2^4 - 2 = 14 usable hosts per subnet)

By applying this 255.255.255.240 mask, the original network is segmented into 16 smaller, independent subnets, such as:
- Subnet 1: 192.10.10.0 to 192.10.10.15 (Network: .0, Broadcast: .15) 
- Subnet 2: 192.10.10.16 to 192.10.10.31 (Network: .16, Broadcast: .31)
- Subnet 3: 192.10.10.32 to 192.10.10.47 (Network: .32, Broadcast: .47) 
- ...

A router will now use this custom mask to determine which sub-network a host belongs to.
