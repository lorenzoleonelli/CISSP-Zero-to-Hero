## Hard Questions ##

1. Your company needs to implement a secure communication protocol between internal systems and is specifically looking for protocols that support mutual (dual) authentication. Which of the following protocols does not provide dual authentication?

A. TLS
B. Kerberos
C. IPsec
D. OAuth 2.0

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is primarily an authorization framework, allowing a user to grant limited access to resources without requiring the resource provider to authenticate the client. By default, it does not support mutual authentication between client and server, which is required for dual authentication scenarios.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. TLS
When configured for mutual TLS (mTLS), TLS provides dual authentication, where both the client and the server authenticate each other using certificates. This is commonly used in high-security environments to ensure secure communications.

❌ B. Kerberos
Kerberos supports mutual authentication through encrypted tickets, verifying both the client and the server within a secure domain. It is widely used in enterprise networks for secure authentication.

❌ C. IPsec
IPsec can enforce mutual authentication between two networked endpoints, using either certificates or pre-shared keys, ensuring that both sides of the connection are verified before transmitting data.

Explanation:
Mutual authentication is crucial for secure communication between systems to prevent impersonation attacks. OAuth 2.0 focuses on delegating access rights rather than authenticating both parties, making it unsuitable for scenarios where dual authentication is required. TLS (with mTLS), IPsec, and Kerberos are protocols that do provide mutual authentication.

2. A company is deploying a new security camera system connected to the network for real-time surveillance. The configuration policy specifies that only devices supporting WPA3 encryption are allowed, and Enterprise (ENT) authentication is not required. Which authentication mechanism is suitable for the cameras to securely connect to the wireless network?

A. Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
B. IEEE 802.1q
C. EAP-FAST
D. IEEE 802.1X

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
SAE is the password-based authentication protocol used in WPA3. It protects against offline dictionary attacks and is ideal for environments without enterprise-level authentication. SAE ensures secure mutual authentication between devices and the access point without the need for centralized servers, making it suitable for security cameras in this scenario.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. IEEE 802.1q
This is a VLAN tagging standard for network traffic segmentation, not an authentication mechanism. It does not handle device authentication.

❌ C. EAP-FAST
EAP-FAST is an enterprise-level authentication protocol designed to work with RADIUS servers. Since ENT authentication is not required in this scenario, EAP-FAST is inappropriate.

❌ D. IEEE 802.1X
802.1X provides port-based network access control, typically requiring a centralized authentication server (e.g., RADIUS). As the policy states ENT authentication is unnecessary, 802.1X is not suitable.

Explanation:
For devices connecting to a WPA3 network without enterprise authentication, SAE is the correct choice. It ensures both device and access point authenticate securely while avoiding the complexity of centralized authentication servers. This is perfect for small deployments like networked security cameras.

3. IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, is a suite of protocols designed to enhance the security of internet communications, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. It enables secure transmission of data over IP networks, safeguarding against unauthorized access and threats. Which of the following are functions of IPsec?

A. Authentication, Link layer protection
B. Authentication, Encryption
C. Hashing, Encryption
D. Authentication, Logging

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ B. Authentication, Encryption
IPsec provides authentication to verify the identities of communicating parties and encryption to protect data in transit. Together, these functions ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communications over IP networks.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Authentication, Link layer protection
While IPsec provides authentication, link layer protection is unrelated, as IPsec operates at the network layer (Layer 3), not the data link layer.

❌ C. Hashing, Encryption
IPsec does use hashing for data integrity, but authentication is a core function that must also be included. This answer is incomplete.

❌ D. Authentication, Logging
IPsec does provide authentication, but logging is not part of its core functionality; logging is handled by monitoring or security systems separately.

Explanation:
IPsec ensures secure communication over IP networks by combining authentication and encryption. Authentication confirms the identity of parties, while encryption protects the content of transmitted data from eavesdropping or tampering. Hashing supports integrity checks, but the essential IPsec functions remain authentication and encryption.

4. While browsing the internet, you notice that a website's URL begins with "https://". Which of the following statements best describes what the "https://" prefix indicates?

A. The client’s public key has been recently updated to ensure secure connections
B. The connection is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt web communications
C. The connection is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt web communications
D. There are no proxy servers involved in this web communication
<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ B. The connection is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt web communications
The "https://" prefix indicates that TLS is used to encrypt data transmitted between the client (browser) and the web server. TLS ensures that communications remain private and secure from eavesdropping or tampering. Although HTTPS originally referred to SSL, TLS has replaced SSL in modern web security.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ C. The connection is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
SSL is outdated and has been largely replaced by TLS. Modern HTTPS uses TLS, making SSL an inaccurate description for current web security.

❌ A. The client’s public key has been recently updated to ensure secure connections
HTTPS does not indicate anything about the client’s public key. The server presents a public key in its certificate; client key updates are unrelated.

❌ D. There are no proxy servers involved in this web communication
HTTPS does not imply the absence of proxies. Encrypted traffic can pass through proxy servers without affecting TLS encryption.

Explanation:
HTTPS ensures secure communication over the internet by encrypting data using TLS. This protects sensitive information from interception, tampering, or eavesdropping, providing confidentiality and integrity for web traffic.
