**Bandwidth:** Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network link in a given time period. It’s a critical factor in network performance and capacity planning.

**Bastion Host:** A bastion host is a specially secured server that acts as a gateway between an internal network and an external network, typically in a DMZ. It is hardened to resist attacks since it is exposed to the internet.

**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):** BGP is a path-vector routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the internet. Misconfigurations or hijacks in BGP can lead to widespread traffic redirection or outages.

**Circuit Switching:** Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path between endpoints for the duration of a session. It is used in traditional telephony but is less efficient than packet switching in data networks.

**Collision Domain:** A collision domain is a network segment where data packets can collide when sent simultaneously. Switches help reduce collision domains, improving network efficiency and speed.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN is a distributed network of servers that delivers web content and media to users based on geographic location. It enhances performance and availability by reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

**Data Link Layer:** The data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes. It handles framing, MAC addressing, and error detection.

**Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):** A DMZ is a separate network segment that acts as a buffer zone between the public internet and an internal network. Services exposed to the internet, such as web and email servers, are placed in the DMZ to reduce security risks.

**Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:** A DoS attack attempts to disrupt the normal operation of a network or service by overwhelming it with traffic. This can cause resource exhaustion, service downtime, and reputational damage.

**Domain Name System (DNS):** DNS translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses used by computers. Compromised DNS can lead to redirection attacks or service outages.

**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with protocol information as it moves through the layers of the OSI model. It enables proper data transmission and routing across networks.

**Encryption:** Encryption transforms readable data into an unreadable format using algorithms and keys to protect confidentiality. It is essential for securing data in transit over untrusted networks.

**Firewall:** A firewall monitors and filters network traffic based on security rules, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. It can be implemented in hardware, software, or both.

**Frequency Hopping:** Frequency hopping is a wireless communication technique that rapidly switches frequencies to reduce interference and enhance security. It’s commonly used in military and Bluetooth communications.

**Full Duplex:** Full duplex communication allows data to be sent and received simultaneously on a network link. This improves bandwidth utilization and reduces latency in modern networks.

**Honeypot:** A honeypot is a decoy system set up to lure and monitor attackers, helping to detect unauthorized activity. It provides valuable intelligence without putting real systems at risk.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):** HTTPS is an encrypted version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to secure data exchange between a browser and a server. It ensures confidentiality and integrity of web communications.

**Internet Protocol (IP):** IP is the principal protocol in the internet layer of the TCP/IP model, responsible for addressing and routing packets between hosts. IPv4 and IPv6 are the two main versions in use.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats. It alerts administrators when potential security incidents are detected, aiding in timely response and mitigation.

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** An IPS actively analyzes and takes action on network traffic, blocking malicious activity in real-time. It prevents attacks from reaching their targets by dropping malicious packets or severing connections.

**Internet Protocol Security (IPsec):** IPsec is a suite of protocols that secures IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a communication session. It is commonly used for virtual private networks (VPNs) and securing communications over untrusted networks.

**Jitter:** Jitter refers to the variation in packet arrival times in a network, which can cause disruptions in the flow of data. It negatively affects real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing.

**Key Exchange Algorithm:** Key exchange algorithms facilitate the secure sharing of cryptographic keys between communicating parties. These algorithms, such as Diffie-Hellman, are essential for establishing encrypted sessions.

**LAN (Local Area Network):** A LAN is a network of devices connected within a small geographic area, like a home, office, or campus. It enables fast and efficient communication and resource sharing among devices.

**Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP):** L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support VPNs, typically in combination with IPsec for encryption. It does not provide encryption by itself, making IPsec necessary for securing data.

**Load Balancer:** A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It improves the availability, reliability, and performance of services.

**MAC (Media Access Control) Address:** A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) for communication at the data link layer. It helps ensure devices on a local network are properly addressed.

**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge. This attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.

**Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS):** MPLS is a high-performance routing technique that directs data from one node to another based on short path labels rather than long network addresses. It’s commonly used to improve the speed and reliability of large-scale networks.

**Network Address Translation (NAT):** NAT is used to map private IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address for communication with external networks. It enhances security by masking internal network addresses and helps conserve IPv4 address space.

**Network Segmentation:** Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated sections to improve security and performance. It limits the scope of potential attacks and reduces congestion by controlling traffic flow.

**Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model:** The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application. It helps standardize networking and troubleshooting processes.

**Packet Filtering:** Packet filtering involves inspecting packets at the network layer and making decisions about whether to forward or block them based on predefined rules. It is a basic technique used by firewalls to secure networks.

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network:** A P2P network allows devices to communicate directly with one another without relying on a central server. It is commonly used for file sharing and decentralized applications but can pose security risks if not properly managed.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** PKI is a framework that uses asymmetric encryption to secure communications and verify the identity of users and devices. It involves the use of digital certificates, public/private keys, and a certificate authority (CA).

**Quality of Service (QoS):** QoS refers to the management of network resources to prioritize traffic and ensure optimal performance for critical applications. It is particularly important for real-time services such as VoIP and video conferencing.

**Router:** A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It determines the best path for data to travel across networks and can implement security measures like NAT and ACLs.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It has largely been replaced by TLS (Transport Layer Security) but is still widely referenced.
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): SIP is a signaling protocol used to establish, maintain, and terminate real-time communication sessions in VoIP and video conferencing. It is essential for modern IP-based communication systems.
