# üß† Wireshark Basics: First Steps for Cybersecurity Students

| **Step** | **Action / Concept** | **Example or Command** | **Expected Result** | **Why It Matters ** |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Launch Wireshark** | Open Wireshark as Administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/Mac). | ‚Äî | Wireshark loads and lists available network interfaces. | Running with correct permissions ensures you can **capture live traffic** ‚Äî part of **security monitoring**. |
| **2. Identify Active Interfaces** | Look for interfaces with increasing packet counters. | *Example:* `Wi-Fi`, `Ethernet0`, or `lo` (loopback). | You see live packet counts incrementing. | Helps **understand network layers** and which adapter is carrying traffic. |
| **3. Start a Capture** | Double-click an interface to start capturing packets. | ‚Äî | Packets scroll in real time. | Shows the **visibility of network communication** ‚Äî key for **forensics and troubleshooting**. |
| **4. Observe Live Packets** | Watch Source, Destination, Protocol, and Info columns. | *Example:* `192.168.1.5 ‚Üí 142.250.184.14  HTTPS Client Hello` | See many simultaneous connections. | Builds intuition about **protocol diversity** (ARP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS). |
| **5. Pause Capture** | Click the red square (‚ÄúStop Capturing Packets‚Äù). | ‚Äî | Capture stops, file ready for analysis. | Allows safe analysis without losing data. |
| **6. Apply Display Filters** | Use filters to view specific traffic. | *Examples:* `http`, `dns`, `tcp.port == 443`, `ip.addr == 8.8.8.8` | Only packets matching the filter appear. | Teaches **filter logic** ‚Äî fundamental for **packet analysis and intrusion detection**. |
| **7. Understand the Three Panes** | Wireshark shows three sections: *Packet List*, *Packet Details*, and *Packet Bytes*. | Click a packet to expand layers: Ethernet ‚Üí IP ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí Application. | You see OSI Layer encapsulation. | Reinforces **layered network understanding** for **defense-in-depth**. |
| **8. Inspect a DNS Query** | Filter: `dns`. Click on a DNS packet. | Observe the query for `www.google.com`. | Shows clear text DNS request. | Demonstrates **information leakage** without encryption ‚Äî relates to **confidentiality**. |
| **9. Inspect an HTTP Request** | Filter: `http`. | Find `GET /index.html` or `POST /login`. | View URL paths and sometimes credentials. | Highlights why **HTTPS is essential** ‚Äî supports **confidentiality and integrity**. |
| **10. Follow a TCP Stream** | Right-click a packet ‚Üí *Follow ‚Üí TCP Stream*. | View full client-server conversation. | Displays request and response in plain text. | Key forensic skill: reconstructing sessions to find data exfiltration. |
| **11. Save a Capture** | File ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí choose `.pcapng`. | *Example:* `my_first_capture.pcapng`. | File is saved for later review. | Practice **evidence preservation** ‚Äî part of **incident response procedures**. |
| **12. Export Objects** | File ‚Üí Export Objects ‚Üí HTTP / SMB / DICOM. | Extract transferred files (e.g., images, payloads). | Downloads embedded objects from captured traffic. | Demonstrates **data recovery and investigation** after an attack. |
| **13. Use Capture Filters** | Apply before starting capture to reduce noise. | *Examples:* `tcp port 80`, `host 192.168.1.10`. | Wireshark records only desired packets. | Teaches **filtering efficiency** ‚Äî mirrors **security log correlation** concepts. |
| **14. Use Display Filters vs. Capture Filters** | Capture filters use BPF syntax, display filters use Wireshark syntax. | Capture: `port 53` / Display: `dns`. | Know when to filter before or after capturing. | Understanding **filtering scope** avoids missing evidence. |
| **15. Check Statistics Menu** | Navigate to `Statistics ‚Üí Protocol Hierarchy` or `Conversations`. | View breakdown of protocols and top talkers. | Graphs show which protocols dominate traffic. | Supports **traffic profiling and anomaly detection**. |
| **16. Identify Common Protocols** | Filter and study each protocol. | *Examples:* `arp`, `icmp`, `ftp`, `tls`, `dhcp`. | Understand each protocol‚Äôs role. | Reinforces **network fundamentals**  |
| **17. Analyze a Ping (ICMP)** | Filter: `icmp`. Ping `8.8.8.8` from your terminal. | Observe Echo Request and Echo Reply packets. | See network diagnostics in action. | Connects **availability testing** with **network troubleshooting**. |
| **18. Inspect ARP Traffic** | Filter: `arp`. | Look for `Who has 192.168.1.1? Tell 192.168.1.5`. | Shows local address resolution. | Demonstrates **Layer 2 communication** and **spoofing risks**. |
| **19. Observe TLS Handshake** | Filter: `tls.handshake`. | Look for `Client Hello` and `Server Hello`. | See key exchange and cipher negotiation. | Understands **encryption establishment** ‚Äî crucial for **CIA triad**. |
| **20. Mark & Colorize Packets** | Right-click ‚Üí *Colorize Conversation*. | Assign color to a flow (e.g., one TCP stream). | Visually track connections. | Improves **pattern recognition** and analysis efficiency. |
| **21. Add Columns for Analysis** | Right-click on a field ‚Üí *Apply as Column*. | Add ‚ÄúDestination Port‚Äù or ‚ÄúProtocol Version‚Äù. | Custom view appears in main table. | Teaches **data interpretation and evidence customization**. |
| **22. Annotate & Comment** | Right-click a packet ‚Üí *Packet Comment*. | Add note: ‚ÄúSuspicious POST request.‚Äù | Comments saved in the .pcapng file. | Promotes **documentation best practices** in forensics. |
| **23. Save Display Filter Profiles** | Create custom profiles per use case. | `Edit ‚Üí Configuration Profiles`. | Save sets of filters for HTTP, DNS, TLS, etc. | Teaches **repeatable analysis workflows**. |
| **24. Use `tshark` CLI** | Command-line version of Wireshark. | `tshark -i lo -Y "http.request" -c 10` | View packets in terminal. | Essential for **automated monitoring** and scripting in security ops. |
| **25. Ethical Practice Reminder** | Capture only your own or authorized traffic. | ‚Äî | Compliance with laws and policies. | Aligns with **CISSP Code of Ethics** and **legal compliance (Domain 1)**. |
