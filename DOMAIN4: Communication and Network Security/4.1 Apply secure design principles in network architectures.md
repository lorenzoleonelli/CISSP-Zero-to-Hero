## Preface ##

Imagine a castle without walls, gates, or guards—completely exposed to intruders. Would you store your most valuable treasures there? Nope. The same principle applies to information security—without strong network security, even the best data protection strategies can be rendered useless.

Today, every organization relies on networks to connect employees, customers, and systems. Whether you're sending an email, accessing cloud applications, or managing remote servers, network security is the invisible shield that protects your data from cyber threats. Attackers don’t just target endpoints; they exploit network vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive information, disrupt services, or gain unauthorized access to critical systems.

Networks come in different sizes and serve different purposes. Here’s a quick breakdown of the most common ones:

| Network Type | Scope / Size | Typical Use Case | Example |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **PAN** (Personal Area Network) | Very small, a few meters | Connects personal devices like smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headsets | Your phone connected to wireless earbuds |
| **LAN** (Local Area Network) | Small area, such as a home, office, or school | Connects devices with Ethernet or Wi-Fi | Office Wi-Fi network |
| **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) | City or large campus | Connects multiple LANs across a metro area, often via telecom providers | City-wide university network |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network) | Regional, national, or global | Connects multiple locations over long distances | The internet |
| **CAN** (Campus Area Network) | Larger than LAN, smaller than MAN | Connects buildings within a campus, enterprise, or base | Corporate HQ or military base network |
| **SAN** (Storage Area Network) | Specialized network | Provides fast, secure access to shared data storage | Data center storage systems |

In networking, layered security is built using two key concepts:

1. **Layering (The OSI Model & TCP/IP Model)**
Networks are structured in layers, like a cake with multiple security checks at each level. The OSI model has seven layers (from physical cables to application data), while the TCP/IP model simplifies it to four layers. Each layer plays a role, ensuring secure data transmission and preventing unauthorized access.


2. **Domain Separation (Network Segmentation)**
Not everyone should have access to everything. Domain separation isolates sensitive resources—for example, an HR system shouldn’t be accessible from the public Wi-Fi network. This approach minimizes damage in case of a breach. Techniques like VLANs (Virtual LANs) and subnetting help enforce domain separation.

:necktie: As businesses continue to adopt cloud computing, remote work, and IoT devices, network security must evolve to keep up with new threats and attack vectors.

## 4.1.1 Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models ##

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes how computer systems communicate over a network. It provides a structured approach to understanding network interactions and is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals when analyzing vulnerabilities, securing data transmission, and troubleshooting network issues. While modern protocols often align more closely with the TCP/IP model, the OSI model remains an essential foundation for understanding network security, segmentation, and attack vectors.

At its core, the OSI model is layered, with each layer representing a different function in the communication process. These layers ensure that complex network interactions can be broken down into manageable components, making it easier to design, secure, and troubleshoot networks. The OSI model serves as a roadmap for security controls, as threats often target specific layers in different ways. Understanding these layers allows for the implementation of layered security (defense in depth) to mitigate risks effectively.

The ISO-OSI model can be understood as a structured process similar to how a letter is sent from one company to another. The image provides an analogy where each OSI layer is represented by a corresponding role in a business and postal service.

| OSI Layer            | Analogy Role                        | Function in Networking |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Application Layer** | Manager (dictates or writes message) | Creates the data using applications like email or web browsers |
| **Presentation Layer**| Assistant (refines the message)      | Formats, encrypts, and compresses data for proper representation |
| **Session Layer**     | Secretary (addresses and organizes)  | Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions |
| **Transport Layer**   | Driver (delivers to post office)     | Ensures reliable delivery using TCP/UDP and manages flow control |
| **Network Layer**     | Sorting & Distribution (post office) | Routes data packets across different networks to reach destination |
| **Data Link Layer**   | Packaging & Unpacking (prepares letter) | Ensures error-free transmission between directly connected nodes |
| **Physical Layer**    | Delivery Truck (actual transport)    | Transmits raw bits over cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals |

Upon arrival, the process is reversed, with the recipient's company handling the letter in the same layered fashion until it reaches the intended manager, just as network data is received, processed, and presented to the user.

**Encapsulation and decapsulation** are key processes that allow data to travel across networks while maintaining structure and security. When a user sends data (like an email or a webpage request), the message starts at the Application Layer and moves down through the OSI layers. Each layer adds its own information (headers, footers, addressing) to the data before passing it to the next layer.

For example:
1. Application Layer – The message is created (e.g., an email).
2. Transport Layer – Adds TCP/UDP headers for reliable delivery.
3. Network Layer – Adds IP addresses for routing.
4. Data Link Layer – Adds MAC addresses for local delivery.
5. Physical Layer – Converts everything into electrical signals or radio waves.

At the end of this process, what started as simple data has become a structured network packet, ready to be transmitted over the network.
When the data reaches its destination, the process reverses:

1. Physical Layer – Receives raw signals.
2. Data Link Layer – Extracts the data from frames.
3. Network Layer – Reads IP addresses and routes the packet.
4. Transport Layer – Reassembles the message and checks integrity.
5. Application Layer – Finally delivers the message to the user (e.g., displaying the email).

With decapsulation, each layer removes its added information, ensuring that the receiver gets the original data in its intended form.

Now, let's dive a bit deeper into the technical details of each OSI layer and its function in network communication.

The lowest layer, known as the **Physical Layer**, deals with the actual transmission of electrical, optical, or radio signals that carry data across networks. Cybersecurity concerns at this layer revolve around physical security, cable tapping, and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Attackers with physical access to networking hardware can engage in activities such as wiretapping, hardware tampering, or signal jamming. Countermeasures include tamper-proof enclosures, network segmentation, and monitoring for unauthorized physical access.

Moving up, the **Data Link Layer** is responsible for MAC (Media Access Control) addressing, error detection, and handling data frames between devices on the same network segment. Attackers at this layer often exploit weaknesses in switching, MAC address spoofing, and VLAN hopping to intercept or redirect network traffic. Techniques such as ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning allow attackers to manipulate MAC address tables, enabling them to launch Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. Mitigation strategies include port security, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), and VLAN segmentation to prevent unauthorized traffic manipulation.

:bulb: A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface of a device for communication on a network. It is used in data link layer protocols (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi) to ensure that data packets are correctly addressed to devices on a local network.
Here are some key characteristics of a MAC address:

Format: A MAC address is typically written as a 12-digit hexadecimal number, often displayed in 6 groups of two digits separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

Uniqueness: Each MAC address is designed to be globally unique, with the first 3 bytes identifying the manufacturer (assigned by the IEEE) and the last 3 bytes being a serial number assigned to the device by the manufacturer.

Function: The MAC address is used for local network communication. It helps devices identify each other within a local network, such as between a computer and a router or between devices on a wireless network.

Static: Unlike IP addresses, which can change depending on the network, the MAC address is generally static and hardcoded into the network interface hardware (like a Wi-Fi card or Ethernet port).

Role in Networking: The MAC address is used in protocols like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses, ensuring the correct destination for network traffic.

At the **Network Layer**, IP addresses are used to route data between devices across different networks. Security challenges at this layer include IP spoofing, route hijacking, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Attackers may manipulate routing protocols to redirect traffic or overwhelm network resources. Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and Network Access Control (NAC) policies help secure this layer by filtering malicious traffic and enforcing segmentation policies.

The **Transport Layer** is where end-to-end communication is managed, ensuring that data is properly sequenced and delivered without corruption or loss. This layer uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), both of which introduce security risks. Attackers frequently exploit TCP-based attacks, such as SYN floods, session hijacking, and port scanning, to disrupt or intercept communications. Rate limiting, deep packet inspection (DPI), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption are commonly used to protect against these threats.

:bulb: A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines over a network. It serves as an interface between the application and the transport layer. A socket allows an application to send or receive data across a network. Each socket is uniquely identified by a combination of the following:
- IP address: The unique address assigned to a device on the network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- Port number: A numeric identifier that helps differentiate different services or processes on the same machine (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- Transport protocol: The protocol being used, typically either TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

In simple terms, a socket is a combination of:
- The IP address of the host machine.
- The port number used to identify the specific service or application.
- The protocol (TCP or UDP) that specifies the connection type.

A port is a 16-bit number (ranging from 0 to 65535) used by the transport layer to direct data to the correct application or process running on a device. Ports are logically associated with the services running on a machine, helping the operating system manage multiple applications using the same network interface.

Ports are divided into three categories:
- Well-known ports (0–1023): These are reserved for common services and protocols. For example:
Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – used by web browsers.
Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) – used for encrypted web traffic.
Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – used for sending emails.
- Registered ports (1024–49151): These are used by software applications for communication, but they are not as commonly associated with standardized services. Developers can register these ports with the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) for their specific services.
- Dynamic or Private ports (49152–65535): These are ephemeral ports used for short-lived communications. They are often assigned temporarily by the operating system for client-side connections, such as when your browser connects to a website. These ports are not assigned to any particular service and are typically used for the duration of the session.

When a device communicates over the network, it uses a combination of the IP address and port number to ensure that data is sent to the correct application. This is what makes it possible for multiple applications on the same machine to use the same network interface.
- Client-side (Outbound connection):
The client application (e.g., a web browser) creates a socket on a local port and sends data to a remote server using the server's IP address and the target service's port number (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
The operating system assigns a random source port from the dynamic range (49152–65535) for the communication. This allows multiple outgoing connections from the same client device without conflicts.
- Server-side (Inbound connection):
The server listens for incoming connections on a specific port. For instance, a web server will typically listen on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
When a connection request arrives, the server uses the destination port to determine which application (service) should handle the data.

The **Session Layer** manages establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between applications. While this layer is less frequently targeted directly, weaknesses in session management can lead to session hijacking, replay attacks, and unauthorized session resumption. Attackers may steal session tokens or manipulate session state information to gain unauthorized access to applications. Secure authentication mechanisms, proper session expiration policies, and encrypted session tokens help mitigate risks at this layer.

:bulb: In the OSI Session Layer, communication between devices can happen in three different modes:
- Simplex: Data flows in one direction only. One device sends, and the other only receives, like a radio broadcast or TV transmission.
- Half-Duplex: Data flows in both directions, but one at a time. Think of a walkie-talkie, where only one person speaks at a time while the other listens.
- Full-Duplex: Data flows in both directions simultaneously, like a phone call, where both people can talk and listen at the same time.
The Session Layer helps establish, manage, and synchronize these communication modes, ensuring that devices communicate efficiently and without conflicts.

At the **Presentation Layer**, data is formatted for proper interpretation, which includes encryption, compression, and character encoding. This layer is where cryptographic protocols such as SSL/TLS operate, ensuring secure data transmission. Attacks at this layer often involve SSL stripping, downgrade attacks, and improper encryption implementations. The use of strong encryption standards, proper certificate validation, and secure cipher suites is critical to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.

Finally, the **Application Layer** is where end-user applications interact with the network, including protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and DNS. The most high-profile security threats occur at this layer, including phishing attacks, malware distribution, injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting), and API exploitation. Web application firewalls (WAFs), secure coding practices, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are among the most effective countermeasures at this level.

The OSI model is not just a theoretical framework but a practical guide to identifying and mitigating security threats at every stage of network communication. Understanding which layers are being targeted by attackers helps in deploying the right security controls at the right points. Network-based attacks often traverse multiple layers, requiring an approach that integrates firewalls, intrusion detection systems, endpoint protection, and access controls to build a truly resilient security architecture.

The OSI model remains valuable for understanding attack surfaces, segmentation strategies, and security best practices. For example, Zero Trust Security (ZTS) frameworks leverage layered security models to ensure continuous verification and strict access controls across different network layers.

By applying defense-in-depth principles, organizations can reduce exposure to threats at each layer, ensuring that even if one layer is compromised, the attacker does not gain unrestricted access to critical assets. From physical security at the hardware level to encryption at the application level, a thorough understanding of the OSI model empowers cybersecurity professionals to design, implement, and maintain robust security postures against ever-evolving cyber threats.

:brain: All People Seem To Need Data Protection … will help you remember the 7 layers of the OSI model.

:bulb: Non-IP Legacy Protocols refer to older networking protocols that were used before the widespread adoption of the Internet Protocol (IP). These protocols were often designed for specific network architectures or industries and are still found in legacy systems. Here are a few key ones:
- IPX/SPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) – Used in Novell NetWare networks, IPX handled addressing while SPX ensured reliable communication.
- AppleTalk – Developed by Apple for Macintosh networks, it provided automatic addressing and name resolution but was replaced by TCP/IP in modern macOS.
- NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface) – A simple protocol used for small LANs, primarily in early Windows networking, but lacked scalability.
- DECnet – Created by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), it was used for connecting DEC systems before TCP/IP became standard.
- SNA (Systems Network Architecture) – Developed by IBM for mainframes, it was used for enterprise data exchange and is still found in some legacy environments.
While these protocols are mostly obsolete, they may still exist in older systems, requiring special handling for integration or migration to modern IP-based networks.

:bulb: The TCP/IP model is a simplified framework that describes how data moves through a network. It consists of four layers, each handling specific tasks to ensure reliable communication. Unlike the ISO OSI model, which has seven layers, TCP/IP is more practical and widely used in modern networking.
- Application Layer – This is where user applications interact with the network. It includes protocols like HTTP (web browsing), SMTP (email), and FTP (file transfer).
- Transport Layer – Ensures reliable communication between devices. The main protocols here are TCP (connection-oriented, reliable data transfer) and UDP (connectionless, faster but less reliable).
- Internet Layer – Handles addressing and routing. The key protocol is IP (Internet Protocol), which ensures data packets reach the correct destination. It also includes ICMP (error messages) and ARP (address resolution).
- Network Access Layer – Also called the Link Layer, this layer manages physical network connections. It includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and other data link protocols that define how devices communicate on a local network.

The OSI model (7 layers) and the TCP/IP model (4 layers) describe how data moves across networks, but the TCP/IP model is a simpler, real-world version of the OSI model.
Here's how they match:
- The top three layers of OSI (Application, Presentation, and Session) are merged into one layer in TCP/IP: These deal with apps, file formats, and session management (like web browsing or video calls).
- The Transport Layer stays the same: Handles how data is split into chunks and sent reliably (or quickly).
- The Network Layer stays the same: Manages IP addresses and routing.
- The Data Link and Physical Layers are combined into one in TCP/IP: Handles actual data transmission over cables, Wi-Fi, etc.

| **OSI Model**     | **TCP/IP Model**       | **Function**                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Application**    | Application             | Apps like browsers, emails, video streaming    |
| **Presentation**   | —                       | Translates data formats (JPEG, encryption)     |
| **Session**        | —                       | Manages sessions (e.g., keeping you logged in) |
| **Transport**      | Transport               | Ensures reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) delivery  |
| **Network**        | Internet                | Handles IP addresses & routing                 |
| **Data Link**      | Link (Network Access)   | Manages MAC addresses & switches               |
| **Physical**       | — (part of Link layer)  | Deals with actual wires, Wi-Fi, fiber, etc.    |

## 4.1.2 Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 and 6 (IPv6) (e.g., unicast, broadcast, multicast, anycast) ##

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to devices connected to a network, allowing them to communicate with each other. Just like a mailing address helps postal services deliver letters, an IP address ensures that network traffic reaches the correct destination.
Each IP address consists of two main parts:
- Network portion – Identifies the network to which a device belongs.
- Host portion – Identifies the specific device within that network.

Think of it like a street address:
- The Network Portion is the street name (e.g., "Main Street").
- The Host Portion is the house number (e.g., "123").

Together, they form a complete address so data can be delivered to the right location.

The subnet mask defines how much of the IP address belongs to the network and how much belongs to the host. Let’s take for example a  Class C Network (192.168.1.100/24), it has
- IP Address: 192.168.1.100
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)
- The first 24 bits (192.168.1) are the Network Portion.
- The last 8 bits (100) are the Host Portion.

This means all devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 network have the same first three numbers (192.168.1), but different last numbers (host IDs).

The two major versions of IP in use today are **IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4) and **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6).

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and remains widely used despite IPv6 adoption. It uses a 32-bit address space, meaning it supports 2³² (about 4.3 billion) unique addresses.
IPv4 addresses are written in dotted decimal notation, where four 8-bit (or octet) values are separated by dots. Each octet represents a number between 0 and 255.
IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A to E) to allocate network sizes effectively.

<img width="512" height="150" alt="Ipv4_Ipv6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a4e4073-1f52-48e7-8b39-0b1b371b89cd" />

Not all IPv4 addresses are meant for internet use. Some are reserved for private networks.
Private addresses are used within local networks and not routable on the public internet. Devices using these addresses require NAT (Network Address Translation) to communicate externally.

<img width="512" height="150" alt="Ipv4_private" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1509daa1-dfc9-42c4-ab38-1b33848c0add" />

For example, Your home router has one public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.5) but assigns private IPs (192.168.1.x) to devices inside your network. NAT (Network Address Translation) translates internal requests to external ones using the router's public IP.

Public IPs are globally routable on the internet. They are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).

:link: [Iana](https://www.iana.org/numbers) is responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing systems, as well as the Autonomous System Numbers used for routing Internet traffic.  

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks, called subnets. It helps improve network performance and security by organizing IP addresses more efficiently. Subnetting also allows you to use the available IP addresses more effectively and helps to isolate network segments.

When you subnet a network, you're essentially borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address and using them for the network portion. This changes the subnet mask, which determines how many bits are used for the network and host parts of the address.

How Subnetting Works ? An IP address is divided into two parts, as we said, the network portion and the host portion. The subnet mask helps to determine which part is the network portion and which part is the host portion. For example, with the IP address 192.168.1.0 and the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, the first 24 bits (the "255.255.255" part) are the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits (the "0" part) are for host addresses within that network.
Subnetting borrows bits from the host portion and uses them to extend the network portion. This increases the number of available subnets but reduces the number of hosts that can be assigned in each subnet.

:bulb: Let's try a simple example. You have the network 192.168.1.0/24 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0), which means you have 256 total IP addresses (0-255). You want to subnet this network into 4 smaller subnets.
1. Determine how many bits to borrow: To create 4 subnets, you need 2 bits (since 2^2 = 4).
2. Update the subnet mask: The original subnet mask was 255.255.255.0 (or /24), and we borrowed 2 bits for the subnets. This changes the subnet mask to 255.255.255.192 (or /26).
3. New Subnets: With a /26 subnet mask, each subnet has 64 addresses (including the network and broadcast addresses). The 4 subnets will look like this:
- Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/26 (addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.63)
- Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64/26 (addresses from 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.127)
- Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128/26 (addresses from 192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.191)
- Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192/26 (addresses from 192.168.1.192 to 192.168.1.255)

Each of these subnets can have 62 usable IP addresses (after excluding the network address and the broadcast address).

:link: You don’t need to calculate subnets manually, but you must understand how subnetting impacts security policies, access control, and network architecture. A detailed explanation of subnetting is available [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnet)

IPv6 was introduced to solve IPv4 exhaustion. It uses a 128-bit address space, providing 2¹²⁸ addresses (more than enough for every device on Earth).
IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal notation and divided into 8 groups of 16 bits, separated by colons.
An Example of an IPv6 Address is: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

IPv6 allows omitting leading zeros and compressing consecutive zero blocks:
Full Address: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370
Shortened: 2001:db8::8a2e:370

The following table depicts the differences between IPv4 and IPv6:
| Feature         | IPv4                       | IPv6                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Address Length  | 32-bit                     | 128-bit                    |
| Address Format  | Dotted Decimal             | Hexadecimal                |
| NAT Usage       | Required due to exhaustion | Not needed                 |
| Security        | IPSec optional             | IPSec built-in             |
| Broadcast       | Yes                        | No (replaced by multicast) |

Why IPv6 is Important for Cybersecurity ?
- Eliminates NAT: Reduces the attack surface.
- Built-in IPSec: Provides encryption and authentication.
- Better address management: Prevents IP conflicts.

And what are the challenges in IPv6 Adoption ?
- Slow transition from IPv4: Many networks still use dual-stack (IPv4 & IPv6).
- Compatibility issues: Some legacy systems do not support IPv6.
- IPv6 Security: New attack vectors (e.g., rogue Router Advertisements).

The primary objective of any network is to transmit data efficiently and reliably between devices. The Internet Protocol (IP) supports several communication methods to direct data packets between devices, each suited to different network requirements and use cases. These methods include unicast, broadcast, multicast, and anycast, which differ in the number of devices involved and the nature of the data transmission. Let’s take a closer look at each of these methods.

**Unicast** refers to one-to-one communication, where a single sender sends data to a specific destination device, identified by a unique IP address. In unicast communication, the sender specifies the destination address in the packet, and only that device receives the data.
Unicast Characteristics:
- One-to-One: Data is transmitted from one sender to one receiver.
- Point-to-Point Communication: There is a direct, exclusive communication channel between the sender and the receiver.
- Unique IP Address: Each device involved in unicast communication has a unique IP address.

For example, when you visit a website, your computer sends a request to the server hosting the website. The server replies to your computer specifically. This is a typical unicast communication, where the web server sends the response only to your device.
Unicast is most commonly used in situations where communication needs to occur between specific devices:
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Email exchanges
- VoIP calls Unicast ensures that only the intended device receives the data, providing privacy and security in communication.

**Broadcast** refers to one-to-all communication, where a sender sends data to all devices within a specific network. In this mode, the data is transmitted to every device on the network, regardless of whether they need it.
Broadcast Characteristics are:
- One-to-All: Data is sent to all devices within a specified network.
- IP Addressing: Broadcasts use a special broadcast address that all devices on the network can recognize.
- Network-Wide Transmission: Every device within the local network receives and processes the broadcasted data.

Types of Broadcasts:
- Limited Broadcast: This type of broadcast is limited to the local network and uses the address 255.255.255.255. It does not get routed to other networks.
- Directed Broadcast: Directed broadcasts target all devices on a specific network. A directed broadcast uses the network’s address (e.g., 192.168.1.255) to communicate with all devices on that network.

For example when a device wants to discover the MAC address of another device within the same network, it broadcasts an ARP request. Every device on the network will receive the ARP request, but only the device with the matching IP address will reply.

Broadcast is generally used for tasks that require all devices on a local network to process the same message, for example in the following cases:
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- DHCP Discover (for obtaining an IP address in a local network)
- Service announcements (such as network printers broadcasting their availability)


Limitations of Broadcast are:
- Network Congestion: Broadcasting to all devices in a network can lead to unnecessary network traffic and can be inefficient.
- Limited to Local Networks: Broadcasts are usually confined to a single network. Routers typically do not forward broadcast packets to other networks, limiting the scalability.

**Multicast** refers to one-to-many communication, where data is sent from a sender to multiple specific devices in a network or across networks, but not to all devices. Unlike broadcast, multicast communication only targets a defined group of receivers, known as a multicast group.
Multicast Characteristics are:
- One-to-Many: Data is sent to a selected group of devices (known as multicast group members) instead of all devices.
- IP Addressing: Multicast uses special IP address ranges within IPv4 (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255) and IPv6 (ff00::/8).
- Efficient Bandwidth Use: Since the data is sent only to the members of the group, it conserves bandwidth and reduces network congestion compared to broadcast.
- Group Membership: Devices must explicitly join a multicast group to receive the data being sent to that group.

When a device wants to receive multicast traffic, it sends an IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) message to its local router requesting to join a multicast group. Once the router receives this request, it ensures that multicast traffic destined for that group is forwarded to the device.

For example a server can stream live video to multiple clients (e.g., an online webinar) using multicast. Only the clients who have joined the multicast group receive the stream, unlike broadcast where all clients would receive the same stream. Multicast is used in applications where a single data stream needs to be delivered to multiple devices without consuming excessive bandwidth.

**Anycast** refers to a one-to-nearest communication model, where data is sent from a sender to the nearest member of a group of devices, typically based on network topology or routing algorithms. Anycast allows data to be routed to the closest available server or device that is part of the anycast group.

Anycast Characteristics are:
- One-to-Nearest: Data is routed to the nearest member of an anycast group based on routing protocols.
- Routing-Based Decision: The “nearest” device is determined based on network topology and routing algorithms (e.g., BGP – Border Gateway Protocol).
- IP Addressing: Anycast uses a single IP address shared by multiple devices, typically deployed for services like DNS.

For example a DNS query for www.example.com can be routed to the nearest DNS server in the network, improving response time and reliability. If one DNS server goes down, others can take over the responsibility without interruption.
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) use anycast to route user requests to the nearest server that can deliver the requested content (e.g., videos, images), optimizing performance and reducing latency.
Anycast is commonly used in scenarios where low-latency access to services is required and multiple servers are available to handle requests:
- DNS Servers
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Distributed Services like cloud-based applications

Here a comparison table of the different communications type seen so far:
| Communication Type | Target            | Addressing                        | Efficiency             | Example use                               |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Unicast            | One device       | Unique IP Address                 | Direct and Secure      | Web browsing, VoIP calls, File transfer   |
| Broadcast          | All devices      | Broadcast IP (e.g., 255.255.255.255) | Inefficient, congestion | ARP, DHCP Discover                        |
| Multicast          | Selected group   | Multicast IP Range (224.x.x.x)    | Efficient, scalable    | Live video/audio streaming, IPTV          |
| Anycast            | Nearest device   | Shared IP Address                 | Fast, scalable         | DNS, CDN, load balancing                  |

**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** is a core protocol used by network devices to communicate error messages and diagnostic information about network operations. It is essential for managing and troubleshooting network connectivity.

ICMP Characteristics are:
- Error Reporting: ICMP helps in reporting errors such as unreachable destinations or time exceeded in routing.
- Diagnostics: ICMP is used in utilities like ping and traceroute, which help in diagnosing network connectivity issues.

Common ICMP Messages:
- Echo Request & Echo Reply: Used by the ping command to test connectivity between devices.
- Destination Unreachable: Indicates that a router or destination device is unreachable.
- Time Exceeded: Sent when a packet’s TTL (Time to Live) reaches zero, indicating that the packet has been circulating too long in the network.
- Redirect: Informs a device that a better route is available.

ICMP is used primarily for network diagnostics, allowing administrators to check if devices are reachable, measure round-trip time, and identify network issues.

IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) is used by hosts and adjacent routers to establish multicast group memberships. It operates at the network layer and enables devices to inform their local routers about their multicast group memberships.
How IGMP Works:
- Devices that want to join a multicast group send an IGMP report to the local router.
- The router then ensures that multicast traffic for that group is forwarded to the device.

IGMP is used to control the group memberships for multicast communication, ensuring that only the necessary devices receive the multicast data. IGMP Versions:
- IGMPv1: Basic functionality to report multicast group membership.
- IGMPv2: Introduced the ability for hosts to leave multicast groups.
- IGMPv3: Allows for source-specific multicast (SSM), where a device can join a multicast group from a specific source.

Understanding the security risks associated with IP protocols is crucial. There are several common network-based attacks that threaten the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of network communications. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. **IP Hijacking (BGP Hijacking)**
IP hijacking occurs when an attacker takes control of a portion of an IP address block. This can lead to traffic being misdirected to malicious systems, often used for surveillance or data theft. 
- How it works: Attackers advertise a block of IP addresses they do not own through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), causing traffic to be routed through their malicious systems.
- Impact: Data interception, denial of service (DoS), or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

2. **Packet Sniffing**
Packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets transmitted across a network. This can be done by malicious users to gather sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers.
- How it works: Tools like Wireshark can capture and analyze network traffic, including unencrypted data.
- Impact: Exposure of sensitive data, identity theft, or credential theft.

:bulb: Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects data packets traveling through a network. It allows users to see the detailed contents of these packets, which can help troubleshoot network issues, monitor traffic, or analyze security incidents. The Key Steps of Wireshark Functionality are:

Packet Capture:
- Wireshark listens to network traffic on a specific network interface (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
- It collects packets as they are sent or received by devices on the network.

Packet Decoding:
- Wireshark decodes these packets based on various network protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP, DNS).
- It displays detailed information, such as headers, payload, and protocol-specific data.

Filtering and Analysis:
- Users can apply filters to narrow down the captured data, focusing on specific traffic or protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**
A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker may impersonate one or both parties.
- How it works: An attacker may intercept traffic between a user and a server, such as during a DNS query or a login request.
- Impact: Data theft, session hijacking, or altered data.

4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack**
A DDoS attack is an attempt to overwhelm a target with a flood of internet traffic, often by utilizing a botnet of compromised devices.
- How it works: Attackers direct massive amounts of traffic to a server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
- Impact: Service disruption, downtime, loss of revenue.

5. **SYN Flood Attack**
A SYN flood is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends a flood of SYN requests (part of the TCP handshake) to a target server, but never completes the handshake.
- How it works: The server waits for the completion of the handshake, which consumes server resources, leading to exhaustion of available connections.
- Impact: Server crashes, unavailability of services.
