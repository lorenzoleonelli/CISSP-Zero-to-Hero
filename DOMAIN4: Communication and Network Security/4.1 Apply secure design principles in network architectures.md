## Preface ##

Imagine a castle without walls, gates, or guards—completely exposed to intruders. Would you store your most valuable treasures there? Nope. The same principle applies to information security—without strong network security, even the best data protection strategies can be rendered useless.

Today, every organization relies on networks to connect employees, customers, and systems. Whether you're sending an email, accessing cloud applications, or managing remote servers, network security is the invisible shield that protects your data from cyber threats. Attackers don’t just target endpoints; they exploit network vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive information, disrupt services, or gain unauthorized access to critical systems.

Networks come in different sizes and serve different purposes. Here’s a quick breakdown of the most common ones:

| Network Type | Scope / Size | Typical Use Case | Example |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **PAN** (Personal Area Network) | Very small, a few meters | Connects personal devices like smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headsets | Your phone connected to wireless earbuds |
| **LAN** (Local Area Network) | Small area, such as a home, office, or school | Connects devices with Ethernet or Wi-Fi | Office Wi-Fi network |
| **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) | City or large campus | Connects multiple LANs across a metro area, often via telecom providers | City-wide university network |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network) | Regional, national, or global | Connects multiple locations over long distances | The internet |
| **CAN** (Campus Area Network) | Larger than LAN, smaller than MAN | Connects buildings within a campus, enterprise, or base | Corporate HQ or military base network |
| **SAN** (Storage Area Network) | Specialized network | Provides fast, secure access to shared data storage | Data center storage systems |

In networking, layered security is built using two key concepts:

1. **Layering (The OSI Model & TCP/IP Model)**
Networks are structured in layers, like a cake with multiple security checks at each level. The OSI model has seven layers (from physical cables to application data), while the TCP/IP model simplifies it to four layers. Each layer plays a role, ensuring secure data transmission and preventing unauthorized access.


2. **Domain Separation (Network Segmentation)**
Not everyone should have access to everything. Domain separation isolates sensitive resources—for example, an HR system shouldn’t be accessible from the public Wi-Fi network. This approach minimizes damage in case of a breach. Techniques like VLANs (Virtual LANs) and subnetting help enforce domain separation.

:necktie: As businesses continue to adopt cloud computing, remote work, and IoT devices, network security must evolve to keep up with new threats and attack vectors.

## 4.1.1 Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models ##

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes how computer systems communicate over a network. It provides a structured approach to understanding network interactions and is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals when analyzing vulnerabilities, securing data transmission, and troubleshooting network issues. While modern protocols often align more closely with the TCP/IP model, the OSI model remains an essential foundation for understanding network security, segmentation, and attack vectors.

At its core, the OSI model is layered, with each layer representing a different function in the communication process. These layers ensure that complex network interactions can be broken down into manageable components, making it easier to design, secure, and troubleshoot networks. The OSI model serves as a roadmap for security controls, as threats often target specific layers in different ways. Understanding these layers allows for the implementation of layered security (defense in depth) to mitigate risks effectively.
