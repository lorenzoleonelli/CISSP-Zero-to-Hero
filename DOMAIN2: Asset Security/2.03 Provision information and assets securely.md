## 2.3.1 Information and Asset Ownership ##

Asset ownership is a central concept to proper information security. But who exactly owns an asset? While legal ownership may reside with the corporation that purchases a server, the life-cycle owner is the employee or department responsible for its daily operation. This distinction highlights the practical aspect of asset ownership: responsibility for the effective management of the asset throughout its life cycle.

Identifying the asset owner is crucial because it pinpoints the individual ultimately accountable for its protection. While the CEO or authorized delegates hold formal ownership responsibility as defined by governance documents and legal regulations, they often delegate data protection tasks.

:brain: The CEO or their delegates retain formal ownership but delegate data protection tasks to data owners responsible for securing sensitive information.

For instance, the IT department might own servers, with senior management within that department responsible for their protection. These individuals, the data owners, play a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information. Their responsibilities may include:
- Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of information assets. 
- Classifying information assets based on sensitivity levels.
- Implementing and monitoring safeguards to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset.
- Authorizing and revoking access to information based on business need. 
- Adapting security measures in response to evolving environmental and legal/compliance landscapes.

Effective asset management encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, starting with a comprehensive inventory and extending to protection throughout their lifecycle. Tangible assets include hardware and software, while intangible assets encompass data, patents, copyrights, and even a company's reputation. Successfully managing these assets is crucial for preventing losses and maintaining the organization's overall security.

:necktie: Intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand reputation, and customer relationships, often drive a company's competitive advantage and long-term profitability, making them more valuable than physical assets. Unlike tangible assets, which depreciate over time, intangible assets can appreciate in value and generate significant revenue without direct physical limitations.

To streamline hardware asset management, many organizations employ automated **Configuration Management Systems (CMS)**. While primarily used for configuration management, these systems connect to hardware systems to verify settings, providing an efficient way to track and manage assets.

:bulb: A CMS typically integrates with a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), which stores detailed information about each CI and its relationships. This system helps organizations improve change management, reduce downtime, and enhance security by ensuring that all configurations are properly documented, monitored, and controlled.

## 2.3.2 Asset Inventory ##

Asset inventory encompasses the meticulous tracking of all physical and virtual assets within an organization. This includes hardware like computers and servers, software such as operating systems and applications, and even intangible assets like patents and copyrights.
A complete and current asset inventory is necessary for effective security control implementation and monitoring. Without this comprehensive understanding of what needs protection, organizations cannot guarantee the security of their critical assets. This is precisely why asset inventory management is highlighted as the top priority in the widely recognized CIS 20 Controls list.

:link: The CIS20 control list is now actually a CIS 18 control list and can be found [here](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list)

:necktie: An asset inventory should collect essential information such as the asset's name, unique identifier (e.g., serial number), location, owner or responsible party, asset type (hardware or software), and its status (active, retired, under maintenance). Additional details may include the asset’s purchase date, warranty information, and configuration details for IT assets like software versions or network settings. However, collecting too many fields can lead to unnecessary complexity, making it harder to maintain and use the inventory effectively. Focusing on key attributes ensures the inventory remains manageable, relevant, and up-to-date without overwhelming users with excessive details that offer little value for asset management or security purposes.

Managing hardware assets efficiently involves employing tools and processes to track these assets throughout their lifecycle. Organizations commonly utilize databases and inventory applications for this purpose. A popular technique involves **bar-code** systems. Each piece of equipment is tagged with a unique barcode containing details such as model, serial number, and location. Regular scans with barcode readers help verify the organization's control over its hardware. A more advanced method leverages **Radio-frequency Identification (RFID)** tags, which transmit information wirelessly to RFID readers. While RFID systems incur higher costs compared to barcode systems, they offer a significant advantage in terms of time efficiency for conducting inventory checks.

:bulb: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track objects, animals, or people via RFID tags. These tags contain a microchip and an antenna, allowing them to store and transmit data wirelessly to an RFID reader. When the reader emits a radio signal, the tag responds with its stored information, which is then processed by a system for inventory management, access control, or asset tracking. RFID tags can be passive (powered by the reader's signal) or active (with their own battery for longer range). This technology is widely used in supply chains, contactless payments, security access systems, and even smart passports.

Prior to disposing of any hardware, **sanitization** is essential. This process involves meticulously removing all data to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Checklists are valuable tools for ensuring thorough sanitization, encompassing steps for hard drives, non-volatile memory, and removable media.. Portable media containing sensitive data, such as USB drives, should also be treated as assets and incorporated into the inventory management system.

:link: For detailed procedures on drive sanitization, refer to [NIST 800-88r1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r1/final) section 2.4.

Software assets encompass operating systems and applications used by an organization. Managing these assets effectively necessitates focusing on software licensing and preventing the use of unauthorized software. Organizations invest in software licenses, often utilizing license keys for activation, which typically involve communication with a licensing server to curb piracy. Protecting these license keys is crucial as leakage can invalidate the organization's software usage rights.
Monitoring license compliance is another critical aspect of software asset management, both for legal and security reasons. For instance, if an organization possesses a license for five software installations but has only activated one, the remaining activations could be exploited if the key is compromised. This highlights the need to treat license keys as valuable assets and safeguard them appropriately.
Ensuring that systems are free from unauthorized software is equally important. Various tools exist to remotely inspect systems, identifying unauthorized software and aiding organizations in maintaining compliance with [software licensing regulations](https://github.com/lorenzoleonelli/CISSP-Zero-to-Hero/edit/main/DOMAIN1%3A%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/1.04%20Understand%20legal%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20compliance%20issues%20that%20pertain%20to%20information%20security%20in%20a%20holistic%20context.md#there-are-four-prevalent-types-of-license-agreements-in-use-today).

Intangible assets, such as intellectual property, patents, trademarks, and a company's reputation, as we already said, also require careful management. Although these assets lack a physical form, they hold significant value for an organization and need protection. Assigning a monetary value to intangible assets can be challenging, often involving estimations of their potential benefits to the organization.
For instance, the value of a patent can be estimated based on the revenue generated from products based on that patent. In the United States, patents have a validity period of 20 years, which can also factor into the valuation process.

:link: See also [1.4.2](https://github.com/lorenzoleonelli/CISSP-Zero-to-Hero/blob/main/DOMAIN1%3A%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/1.04%20Understand%20legal%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20compliance%20issues%20that%20pertain%20to%20information%20security%20in%20a%20holistic%20context.md#142-licensing-and-intellectual-property-requirements)

Maintaining patents requires periodic fee payments, emphasizing the importance of diligent tracking to avoid potential loss. Large organizations typically report intangible asset values on their balance sheets in accordance with **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)**. This practice ensures regular review and highlights the significance of intangible assets in an organization's overall financial health.

:link: More info about GAAP is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States))

Given the scale and dynamic nature of asset inventories, automated tools may be indispensable. These tools, including system enumeration and endpoint management systems, provide visibility into the organization's assets and facilitate the discovery of any new or undocumented assets. Asset information is gathered through agents, client software, integration with various scanning tools, or data feeds from vendors in the case of cloud-based assets. Organizations often leverage a combination of existing tools like Active Directory, vulnerability scanners, and software license management tools to build their asset inventory system.
The choice of specific tools depends on the organization's needs and existing infrastructure. However, **a crucial element is establishing a single, authoritative system of record for the asset inventory**. This system serves as the ultimate source of truth, resolving any conflicts that may arise from data collected by different tools. It's crucial to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data in the system of record, as it forms the basis for official reports and audit responses.

Beyond the tools themselves, effective inventory management hinges on well-defined processes. This includes establishing clear guidelines for updating the inventory, including the frequency of updates and procedures for manually notifying the system when assets are added, removed, or significantly modified. In dynamic environments with frequent software deployments and fluctuating endpoint numbers, using automated tools to discover, track, and provision assets is often preferred. 

:necktie: Knowing your assets is the first step in effectively protecting them. (This is so important and so often forgotten in companies)
