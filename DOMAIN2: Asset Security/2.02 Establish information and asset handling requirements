## 2.2 Establish information and asset handling requirements ##

The first step towards effective data handling is data maintenance, which encompasses organizing and caring for data from its creation to its eventual disposal. This includes implementing access controls and classifying data based on its sensitivity. For example, a network with proper security controls can safeguard data by separating classified and unclassified networks, preventing unauthorized access.

Data loss prevention (DLP) systems play a crucial role in detecting and blocking data exfiltration attempts.These systems work by identifying specific data patterns, such as Social Security numbers or credit card details, and flagging any attempts to send this information outside the organization. DLP systems come in two primary types: network-based and endpoint-based. Network-based DLP scans all outgoing data, while endpoint-based DLP focuses on data leaving specific devices, such as printers or USB drives.
