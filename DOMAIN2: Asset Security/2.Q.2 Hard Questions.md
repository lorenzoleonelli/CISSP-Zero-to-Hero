## 2.Q.2 Hard Questions ##

1. You are tasked with classifying company assets in terms of sensitivity and importance. Which factor is the most important when determining the classification of an asset?

(A) The asset's EOS (End of Service) and EOL (End of Life)
(B) The Exposure Factor (EF) of the asset
(C) The sum of the value of the asset and the data it holds
(D) The value of the countermeasures in place to protect the asset

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (C) The sum of the value of the asset and the data it holds

Explanation:
Asset classification depends primarily on the combined value of the asset itself and the data it contains. This reflects the asset’s operational and security importance to the organization, helping determine its classification (e.g., critical, sensitive) and the security controls required.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) The asset's EOS and EOL: These factors are important for lifecycle management but do not determine classification based on sensitivity or business impact.

(B) The Exposure Factor (EF): EF measures potential loss in a risk assessment but does not directly determine asset classification.

(D) The value of countermeasures: Security controls protect assets but do not dictate how an asset should be classified.

Overall Explanation:
Proper classification of assets ensures that protection measures and risk management efforts are aligned with the criticality and sensitivity of both the asset and the data it contains, not just its age, potential exposure, or existing safeguards.

3. Your company regularly backs up data from servers onto magnetic tapes. Some tapes are reused, and data is deleted before putting them back into circulation. You don’t need to preserve the tapes’ longevity. What’s the best method for deleting the data on these tapes?

(A) Formatting
(B) Clearing
(C) Erasing
(D) Purging

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (D) Purging

Explanation:

Purging: The most secure and thorough method for deleting data on magnetic tapes. It uses specialized techniques, often overwriting data multiple times with random information, making recovery virtually impossible. Ideal when tapes are reused and tape longevity is not a concern.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect:

Clearing: Makes data unreadable but may leave remnants. Less secure than purging.

Formatting: Removes the file system but does not reliably overwrite data; some data may remain recoverable.

Erasing: Deletes only directory entries or links; the actual data remains and can be recovered.

Overall Explanation:
Purging ensures all sensitive data is irrecoverably removed from magnetic tapes before reuse, preventing potential data leakage. It is the recommended practice for reusable media where security is the priority over media longevity.

4. Your organization is reviewing its policies to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Which policy defines the amount of time specific types of data should be retained before secure disposal?

(A) Data Protection Policy
(B) CIA Policy
(C) Data Collection Policy
(D) Record Retention Policy

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (D) Record Retention Policy

Explanation:

Record Retention Policy: Specifies how long different types of records and data should be kept. It ensures compliance with legal, regulatory, and operational requirements, including secure disposal once the retention period expires.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect:

Data Collection Policy: Focuses on how data is gathered and consented, not how long it is retained.

Data Protection Policy: Ensures data security and privacy, but doesn’t set retention timelines.

CIA Policy: Refers to confidentiality, integrity, and availability principles, not retention periods.

Overall Explanation:
A Record Retention Policy is essential for regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. It provides clear guidance on retention timeframes and secure disposal methods, reducing legal and data privacy risks.

5. Your organization is preparing to share a database with an external research partner. Which technique permanently removes privacy-related data, making it impossible to recover the original information?

(A) Tokenization
(B) Purging
(C) Pseudonymization
(D) Anonymization

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (D) Anonymization

Explanation:

Anonymization permanently removes all identifiable information from a dataset, ensuring that it is impossible to trace back to the original data. This makes the data irreversibly de-identified and compliant with privacy regulations when sharing with third parties.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect:

Tokenization: Replaces sensitive data with tokens but retains a reversible mapping to the original data. It secures data in transit or storage but does not fully remove it.

Pseudonymization: Substitutes identifiers with placeholders but can be reversed with access to keys or other data. It reduces privacy risk but doesn’t permanently remove the data.

Purging: Securely deletes data from storage media but applies to devices or files, not to de-identifying database content.

Overall Explanation:
Anonymization is the only method that guarantees privacy-related data cannot be recovered, making it suitable for sharing datasets without violating privacy regulations.

6. You are implementing a secure payment system for your e-commerce platform. Regarding tokenization, which statement about tokens is true?

(A) A token is generated using an encryption key.
(B) A token can be reversed to reveal the original data without additional information.
(C) A token always contains the same number of characters as the original data.
(D) On its own, a token has no meaningful information.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (D) On its own, a token has no meaningful information.

Explanation:

A token is a surrogate value representing the original data but carries no intrinsic meaning. For example, a token for a credit card number cannot be used to infer the actual number. This ensures that even if a token is intercepted, sensitive information remains protected.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect:

A token is generated using an encryption key: Tokenization is not based on encryption. Tokens are generated by a mapping mechanism (e.g., a token vault) rather than mathematically transforming the data with a key.

A token can be reversed without additional information: Tokens are not reversible unless the secure mapping (token vault) is consulted. Unlike encryption, they cannot be mathematically reversed without this reference.

A token always contains the same number of characters as the original data: Token length and format are not necessarily the same as the original data. Some systems may preserve formatting for usability, but it is not a defining property.

Overall Explanation:
Tokens provide a way to represent sensitive data safely. They are meaningless outside the context of the tokenization system, making them a strong measure for protecting customer information in payment systems.

7. Your organization is preparing to dispose of old storage media securely, ensuring no sensitive data can be retrieved. Which statements about purging are true? (choose all that apply)

(A) It overwrites the media with a series of 1s and 0s multiple times.
(B) It involves formatting the media multiple times to remove data.
(C) It uses a magnetic field to remove all data from the media.
(D) It leaves the media in a state that can be reused.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answers: (A) It overwrites the media with a series of 1s and 0s multiple times, (D) It leaves the media in a state that can be reused.

Explanation:

Purging securely removes data by overwriting the storage media with patterns of 1s and 0s multiple times. This ensures that residual data cannot be recovered using forensic tools.

Unlike destruction methods such as shredding or degaussing, purging allows the media to remain functional and reusable after the process.

Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect:

It uses a magnetic field to remove all data from the media: This describes degaussing, which often makes the media permanently unusable.

It involves formatting the media multiple times to remove data: Formatting alone, even repeated, does not guarantee secure deletion of sensitive information and may leave recoverable traces.

Overall Explanation:
Purging is a secure, standardized method to erase data while keeping the media reusable, making it ideal for recycling or repurposing storage devices without risking data leakage.

8. According to NIST SP 800-88, arrange the following forms of data sanitization in ascending order of effectiveness, starting with the least effective method:

(A) Encrypt, Degauss, Erase
(B) Format, Encrypt, Degauss
(C) Degauss, Format, Media Destruction
(D) Encrypt, Format, Drill

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (B) Format, Encrypt, Degauss

Explanation:

Format: Least effective. Only removes pointers to data in the file system; data can often be recovered.

Encrypt: Makes data unreadable without the key, increasing security over simple formatting.

Degauss: Most effective among these options. Disrupts the magnetic field of the storage media, rendering data nearly impossible to recover.

Additional Notes:
NIST SP 800-88 provides a hierarchy of sanitization effectiveness:
Format < Overwrite < Encrypt < Degauss < Shred < Media Destruction

Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

Encrypt, Degauss, Erase: Erase is less effective than degaussing, so this order is wrong.

Degauss, Format, Media Destruction: Degauss is not the least effective, so this sequence is incorrect.

Encrypt, Format, Drill: While drilling is a form of physical destruction and very effective, the relative order of encrypt vs. format is reversed here.

9. Which standard can be universally applied by all Federal agencies to classify information and information systems, ensuring appropriate security levels according to risk?

(A) OSA (Official Secrets Act)

(B) NIST SP 800-60

(C) ISO 27001

(D) NIST SP 800-39

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (B) NIST SP 800-60

Explanation:

NIST SP 800-60, “Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories,” is specifically designed for U.S. federal agencies. It provides guidance on categorizing information and information systems so that security controls align with the level of risk.

Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

OSA (Official Secrets Act): A UK law for protecting national secrets; not a standard for risk-based categorization.

ISO 27001: Focuses on establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS), not on risk-based classification of information.

NIST SP 800-39: Provides guidance on managing information security risk, but does not define a framework for categorizing information and systems.
