## 2.4.1 Data roles (i.e., owners, controllers, custodians, processors, users/subjects) ##

In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding the roles and responsibilities associated with data management is paramount. These roles encompass a spectrum of individuals, each playing a crucial part in ensuring the security and integrity of an organization's valuable asset - data. Let's delve into the key players involved and their distinct contributions.


**Data Owners** sit at the apex of this hierarchy, bearing the ultimate responsibility for data. Often, this mantle falls upon senior leaders such as the CEO, president, or department heads. Their responsibilities are multifaceted, encompassing data classification, ensuring appropriate security controls based on classification and organizational security policies, and defining rules for data use and protection. A critical aspect of their role is collaborating with system owners to establish security controls for data access and use. Data owners are also accountable for their data and can be held liable for negligence if sensitive information under their purview is misused or disclosed without authorization. They wield the authority to grant or deny access to their data, emphasizing their pivotal role in data governance.


**Data Controllers** are the architects of data processing, determining the purpose, conditions, and methods of handling personal data. This role gained significant prominence with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), highlighting the importance of adhering to principles like lawfulness, fairness, transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitations, integrity, and confidentiality. Data controllers engage in data processing agreements with data processors to ensure robust privacy protections for personal data. While often synonymous with data owners, this distinction becomes crucial when organizations outsource data processing responsibilities to third parties, such as cloud service providers or managed service providers. In such scenarios, the data owner may delegate the responsibility of establishing data processing requirements to a third party, but ultimately retains accountability for the data's security.


**Data Custodians** are the guardians of data, ensuring its security and integrity within the IT infrastructure.. Their responsibilities are primarily technical, focusing on tasks such as data storage, backup, and maintenance of audit logs. They operate under the guidance of data owners and business requirements, implementing security controls and ensuring auditability of data and its usage. Typically residing within the IT department, data custodians play a critical role in translating data management policies into tangible security measures.


**Data Processors** handle data on behalf of the data owner, responsible for tasks like transferring, transmitting, or manipulating data. Their role is crucial in data protection, especially in sectors like healthcare and banking, where data exchange is essential for various operations. Data processors, however, do not share the legal responsibility and accountability of data controllers. They operate under the direction of the data controller, who dictates the purpose and methods of data processing. A prime example is cloud providers, often categorized as data processors due to their role in handling data based on instructions from the data controller.. It's worth noting that individuals within organizations may assume both processor and controller roles depending on the context. For instance, an HR firm acts as a data controller for their employee data but transitions to a data processor role when handling client data for outsourced HR tasks, with the client retaining the data controller status.


**Data Users** are the individuals who consume or utilize data for specific purposes. They rely on data processors to ensure data availability and performance, often holding them accountable through service-level agreements (SLAs) and contractual obligations. Their focus is on leveraging data to achieve their objectives, making them the ultimate beneficiaries of secure and reliable data management practices.


**Data Subjects**, as defined by the GDPR, are the individuals whose personal information is collected and processed. The core objective of data protection regulations like the GDPR is to safeguard the privacy and rights of data subjects. Understanding the data subject's perspective is crucial for ensuring ethical and responsible data handling practices.

    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

The data lifecycle begins with **data collection (or data creation)**, which encompasses data creation, acquisition, aggregation, or any instance where data enters an organization's system. This initial phase is where secure defaults, privacy by design, and other security principles are critical. Embedding security measures from the outset, rather than as an afterthought, is a cornerstone of best practices and regulatory requirements. It's also crucial to obtain consent or have a legitimate legal basis for collecting data, as emphasized by regulations like the GDPR.

Data classification, typically conducted during data collection or creation, is essential for applying appropriate security controls. Additionally, tagging data with relevant attributes and establishing access restrictions are crucial steps in this phase. 

:link: Review what you have learned in [2.1.1 Data Classification](https://github.com/lorenzoleonelli/CISSP-Zero-to-Hero/blob/main/DOMAIN2%3A%20Asset%20Security/2.01%20Identify%20and%20classify%20information%20and%20assets.md#211-data-classification)

:Necktie: The decisions made during data collection will have implications throughout the entire lifecycle. 

By understanding and effectively managing the data lifecycle, Security professionals can contribute significantly to securing their organizations' information assets. This involves implementing appropriate security controls at every stage, adhering to relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, and fostering a culture of data security awareness throughout the organization. 

One of the fundamental principles of data security is **data minimization**, which advocates for collecting only the data absolutely necessary for business operations. This approach, enshrined in many privacy regulations worldwide, is not just a best practice; it is often a legal requirement. 

Privacy brings many laws and regulations. This legal patchwork necessitates a thorough understanding of the applicable laws in the jurisdictions where an organization operates, especially when outsourcing services or storing data across borders. Imagine an e-commerce company that collects extensive customer information, including credit card details, for every purchase. A data breach in this scenario could lead to significant liabilities and reputational damage. Conversely, a company that only collects data for its intended purpose, like processing payments through a secure third-party processor without storing sensitive information, effectively mitigates the risk of losing valuable customer data.

:necktie: To establish a robust data security posture, organizations must define a clear and comprehensive data privacy policy, often divided into internal and external documents to address employee and customer data separately.

A data privacy policy should answer crucial questions regarding the types of data collected, the purpose of collection, data sharing practices, data ownership, subject rights, data retention periods, and relevant legal and regulatory frameworks.

:necktie: An approach like *keeping it just in case it becomes useful someday* is not acceptable for data management or asset collection.

## 2.4.3 Data location ##

Data location refers to the physical or geographical whereabouts of data at rest and data backups or copies. This seemingly simple concept has far-reaching implications for organizations, especially when handling sensitive data like personal information, healthcare records, or national security secrets. Understanding data location is crucial for ensuring compliance with international regulations and upholding data security best practices.

Several factors contribute to the complexity of data location. Firstly, many countries have enacted data localization laws. These laws mandate that specific types of data, often related to citizens' personal information, be stored and processed within the country's geographical boundaries. Examples of such legislation can be found in China and Russia. The rationale behind data localization often stems from national security concerns, data sovereignty, and the desire to protect citizens' privacy.
China's Cybersecurity Law, enacted in 2016, serves as a prime example of data localization in action. This law grants the Chinese government significant control over cybersecurity practices within the country, particularly for industries deemed "critical information infrastructure" (CII). These industries, including energy, finance, transportation, and healthcare, possess data that could pose risks to national security or public interest if compromised. Foreign companies operating within these sectors in China are obligated to either establish local servers and data centers or collaborate with Chinese data management companies like Alibaba or Tencent. This exemplifies the stringent requirements that data localization laws can impose on international businesses.

:link: Curious about privacy and data location laws in the world ? https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/

In addition to data localization, data sovereignty laws further complicate the landscape. These laws stipulate that any entity, regardless of their location, handling specific data types, typically personal data of a country's citizens, must comply with that nation's regulations. Meeting these multifaceted requirements can be challenging, even impossible, without a robust data classification system in place.

:necktie: Cloud service providers can play a crucial role in both enabling and hindering compliance with data location mandates.

:brain: The Data controller is in any case accountable for PII, he/she can delegate responsibility for Data processing.

When properly leveraged, cloud services can restrict specific data classifications to a particular region or country, ensuring adherence to data localization rules. Conversely, if data location is not carefully considered during cloud solution architecture, sensitive data might end up stored in unintended locations, potentially leading to legal repercussions and financial penalties for data owners.

Beyond legal and regulatory compliance, data location significantly impacts disaster recovery and business continuity. Organizations often maintain backups of their critical data at different locations to mitigate risks associated with natural disasters, cyberattacks, or other disruptive events. The geographical distance between the primary data storage and the backup location is a crucial consideration. For example, storing a backup copy in the same building as the primary data center would defeat the purpose of having a backup if a fire or other localized disaster were to occur. Ideally, backup data should be located far enough from the primary site to minimize the likelihood of both locations being affected by the same event. This concept extends to cloud storage, where organizations need to verify the physical location of their cloud backups to ensure they reside in a geographically separate area.

:necktie: Data location considerations should be interwoven into every stage of data management, from initial data classification to cloud architecture design and disaster recovery planning. 

:brain: **Data localization** refers to the practice of storing and processing data within the geographical boundaries of a specific country or region, often due to legal or regulatory requirements. **Data sovereignty**, on the other hand, is a broader concept that asserts that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is collected or processed, regardless of where it is stored. While data localization focuses on the physical location of data storage, data sovereignty is concerned with the legal authority and control over data.

Laws and regulations governing data location and sovereignty are constantly evolving. Continuous research and staying updated on legal developments in relevant jurisdictions are crucial.

### Open Questions ###

1. What is the importance of off-site data backups, and how does geographical distance play a role in effective backup strategies?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Off-site data backups protect against data loss from disasters like fires or floods that could impact the primary data storage location. Geographical distance between the primary site and the backup location is crucial to ensure the backup isn't affected by the same event.

## 2.4.4 Data Maintenance ##

The Use phase in the secure data lifecycle is where data truly comes alive. After being carefully collected and stored, it's in this phase that data is processed, analyzed, and shared across your organization to fulfill its intended purpose. However, ensuring the security and integrity of your data during this dynamic stage can be quite a challenge. We can think of it like a city - the more activity and movement there is, the more crucial it becomes to maintain order and safety.

:necktie: Maintaining data security during the "Use" phase requires a delicate balance between functionality and security. 

Let's say you have customer information stored in multiple systems across your organization. If a customer's details change, it's vital to update that information everywhere, not just in one system. Failing to do so can lead to confusion, errors, and even potential legal issues. Imagine a scenario where incorrect data about an individual is shared with law enforcement or other organizations, leading to severe consequences. This highlights the importance of having a robust plan for maintaining data accuracy and addressing any errors promptly.

Protecting sensitive data within an organization requires strategic segregation and controlled access measures. Consider the analogy of a building with different security levels. The most sensitive areas, like a server room, require strict access controls and may be physically separated from less sensitive areas. Similarly, organizations can implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive data from the rest of the network. Techniques like air gaps, where physically separate networks are used to house classified and unclassified data, provide enhanced protection against unauthorized access. As usual with countermeasures,  while air gaps provide robust security, they can also create challenges when it comes to data updates and transfers. 

Organizations must continuously review and update their data policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective. This involves not only staying abreast of industry best practices and emerging threats but also regularly assessing how well personnel adhere to established policies. Think of it as ongoing maintenance for your security infrastructure - regular inspections, adjustments, and repairs are necessary to keep everything running smoothly and protect your valuable data assets.

:bulb: Practical ways for taking care of your data are:
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions: These tools can help detect and prevent sensitive data from leaving your organization's control, whether intentionally or accidentally.

## 2.4.5 Data Retention ##

Data retention is a critical aspect of asset management and security. Organizations must establish comprehensive data retention policies and procedures that outline what data to keep, how long to keep it, and where to keep it. 

:necktie: Data retention policies should be aligned with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements, as well as business needs and privacy considerations. 

There is no universal standard for data retention, as requirements vary across countries and industries. However, organizations should adhere to documented data retention policies and conduct regular audits to ensure compliance. When outsourcing data storage, it's crucial to specify in the contract the retention period and data eradication process after terminating the service.
Determining the appropriate data retention period requires careful consideration. A common approach is to identify data sets subject to mandated retention requirements and handle them accordingly. For all other data, retention periods should minimally satisfy business requirements, which may differ across various business units. For instance, research and development data might be retained longer than customer service call recordings.

Data retention policies should address three key questions:
1. **What data do we keep?** This involves identifying data needed for analysis, historical knowledge, regulatory compliance, and business operations. Legal counsel should be involved to ensure all legal obligations are met. 
2. **How long do we keep this data?** This requires considering statutory, regulatory, and best practice guidelines, as well as case law. Retention periods vary depending on the type of data. 
3. **Where do we keep this data?** The focus here is on the manner in which data is stored and its accessibility for retrieval. Retained data should be easy to locate and retrieve to comply with legal requests or business needs.

Effective data retention policies strike a balance between business needs and employee or customer privacy. They should ensure that data is retained deliberately, specifically, and enforceably, with mechanisms for prompt and proper disposal of data that should not be retained. Data retention policies must address the challenges posed by the volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value of data. Organizations should adopt a retention policy that enables the creation of big data stores as needed while balancing risks, costs, and value. This involves considering privacy, legal liability, e-discovery implications, data usefulness, storage costs, and data removal procedures. 

To ensure the accessibility of retained data, several factors should be considered: 
1. **Taxonomy**: A scheme for classifying data based on categories such as functional, chronological, or organizational. 
2. **Classification**: Assigning sensitivity classifications to data to determine appropriate controls during use and archiving. 
3. **Normalization**: Converting data into a standardized format for efficient storage and retrieval. 
4. **Indexing**: Creating indexes to facilitate quick and efficient data searching.

:bulb: Windows indexing is a process that creates an index of files and their contents to improve search speed and efficiency. It scans the files on the computer, storing metadata (like file names, types, and locations) and, in some cases, the actual content of documents, so they can be quickly retrieved. This index is updated periodically, ensuring that search queries return fast, relevant results without having to scan the entire file system each time.

E-discovery, the process of producing electronically stored information (ESI) relevant to a legal proceeding, can be streamlined with robust data retention policies and procedures. 
The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) outlines eight steps involved in e-discovery:
1. Identification of relevant data. 
2. Preservation of data to prevent destruction. 
3. Collection of data from various storage locations. 
4. Processing to ensure correct data and metadata format. 
5. Review for relevance. 
6. Analysis for context. 
7. Production of the final data set. 
8. Presentation.
