Correct Answer: (B)

Creating a cross-functional team focused on the security of both digital and physical smart assets ensures that all relevant perspectives—IT, security, clinical, and compliance—are considered. This collaboration is essential in healthcare, where interconnected devices and systems must meet stringent safety and privacy requirements. By aligning technical, operational, and compliance efforts, the organization can better identify and mitigate risks that emerge from digital health technologies, such as device tampering, unauthorized data access, and network vulnerabilities.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) Training staff on secure data handling and privacy is valuable but insufficient on its own. It raises awareness but does not provide the technical or structural safeguards required for securing connected medical devices.

(C) Developing an ITIL framework supports IT service management but does not directly address the specific security needs of digital and physical healthcare assets.

(D) Allocating budget to backup and HA solutions improves availability and recovery but does not actively protect against security threats or prevent unauthorized access to connected devices.

2. A multinational organization is planning to integrate and centralize its diverse data assets from various global offices into a unified data lake. What primary factor should the organization prioritize to enable effective data governance and ensure compliance with differing international data protection laws?

(A) Implement and test a Business Continuity Plan

(B) Organize a High Availability System

(C) Implementing a comprehensive data classification scheme

(D) Ensure consistent Control Access Systems

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (C)

Implementing a comprehensive data classification scheme is essential because it allows the organization to consistently identify, categorize, and protect data according to its sensitivity and regional regulatory requirements. A unified classification system ensures that appropriate security controls, retention policies, and access permissions are applied based on the data’s type and jurisdiction. This approach supports both effective data governance and compliance with international privacy and protection laws such as GDPR or HIPAA.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) Implement and test a Business Continuity Plan — While crucial for ensuring operational resilience, it focuses on recovery and uptime, not ongoing compliance or regulatory data management.

(B) Organize a High Availability System — High availability improves reliability and uptime but does not address compliance or regulatory alignment in handling diverse global data.

(D) Ensure consistent Control Access Systems — Consistency in access control is valuable, but compliance requires context-aware controls that differ by data type and region, which classification enables.

3. A bank relies on a critical financial software application that has reached End-of-Life (EOL) with no available upgrade path. This software is vital for transaction processing and customer data management. What is the best strategy to ensure the bank’s operations remain uninterrupted while adhering to financial data protection regulations?

(A) Create a Docker container to isolate the software, reducing its exposure to potential threats

(B) Implement strict access controls and continuously monitor for unauthorized access

(C) Migrate all customer data and banking operations to a new, supported software solution

(D) Continue using the software while improving access control policies

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (C)

Migrating to a supported software solution minimizes the security vulnerabilities associated with End-of-Life (EOL) software. Supported systems receive vendor updates, patches, and compliance support, ensuring the bank adheres to financial data protection regulations. This approach not only maintains operational continuity but also strengthens long-term data security and compliance.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) Create a Docker container to isolate the software, reducing its exposure to potential threats
While containerization can add an extra layer of isolation and limit exposure, it doesn’t fix the underlying issue of using unsupported software. The EOL software remains vulnerable and non-compliant, which can expose the bank to security and regulatory risks.

(B) Implement strict access controls and continuously monitor for unauthorized access
Strong access controls and monitoring improve immediate security but do not resolve the fundamental issue—no security patches or vendor support. This option is only a temporary mitigation, not a compliant long-term solution.

(D) Continue using the software while improving access control policies
Continuing to use EOL software, even with enhanced access controls, leaves the bank exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities. This approach fails to meet financial data protection regulations and could result in non-compliance and reputational damage.

4. A fintech startup is expanding its infrastructure and adding more digital assets. The CTO wants to ensure these resources are tracked and managed effectively. What is the most effective strategy for sustainable asset management?

(A) Delegating IT asset management to an external firm with specialized expertise.

(B) Adopting a scalable, cloud-based asset management tool that can grow with the company’s needs.

(C) Prioritizing the use of free or open-source tools to reduce costs and simplify asset tracking.

(D) Distributing asset management tasks across various team leads to monitor their own departments.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (B)

Adopting a scalable, cloud-based asset management tool provides centralized visibility, real-time tracking, and easy scalability as the company grows. This approach ensures that as new assets are added, they are integrated seamlessly into a unified system, enabling efficient control, compliance, and lifecycle management. Cloud-based solutions also provide automation and analytics capabilities that are vital for a rapidly growing fintech environment.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) Delegating IT asset management to an external firm with specialized expertise
While outsourcing might seem convenient, it can be costly and reduce direct control over IT assets. For a fast-moving startup, retaining internal control ensures agility and faster responses to infrastructure changes.

(C) Prioritizing the use of free or open-source tools to reduce costs and simplify asset tracking
Although open-source tools lower costs, they often lack scalability and integration capabilities. Managing multiple tools or limited-feature platforms can become inefficient and resource-intensive as the company expands.

(D) Distributing asset management tasks across various team leads to monitor their own departments
This approach fragments oversight and leads to inconsistencies in tracking and reporting. Without centralized control, assets may be duplicated, lost, or improperly maintained, which can hinder growth and compliance efforts.

5. A healthcare provider is in the process of migrating patient records to a new electronic health record (EHR) system. To meet health information privacy regulations and uphold information and asset ownership standards, the provider must carefully plan and implement data management practices. Which of the following actions should be prioritized to ensure compliance and secure handling of sensitive data?

(A) Assign a data custodian to each department.

(B) Allow unrestricted data access to department heads for operational efficiency.

(C) Encrypt all internal and external communications related to patient records.

(D) Establish a central log of all user access to the EHR system.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (A)

Assigning a data custodian to each department ensures clear accountability and adherence to data governance principles. Data custodians are responsible for safeguarding information assets, enforcing access controls, and maintaining compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA. By designating ownership at the departmental level, the healthcare provider ensures that sensitive data is managed consistently, securely, and in accordance with established policies throughout the EHR migration.

Incorrect Answers:

(B) Allow unrestricted data access to department heads for operational efficiency
Granting unrestricted access violates the principle of least privilege and exposes the organization to potential data breaches. Even senior staff must have access only to the data necessary for their role to comply with healthcare privacy regulations.

(C) Encrypt all internal and external communications related to patient records
Encryption is vital for protecting data in transit, but it does not address data ownership or accountability. While it safeguards confidentiality, it does not ensure that data management practices align with regulatory or governance standards.

(D) Establish a central log of all user access to the EHR system
Logging access provides valuable audit trails for detecting unauthorized use, but it does not establish who is responsible for managing and protecting the data. Assigning data custodians goes a step further by enforcing ownership and ensuring that each department maintains compliance with privacy regulations.
