9. You have determined that all incoming data to your company must be accompanied by metadata. Easy things first: the first condition is that system metadata must be correctly understood. Which of the following are system metadata?

(A) Author, Owner

(B) Classification, Project, Owner

(C) Author, Date of Creation

(D) Owner, Date of Creation, Permission

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (C)

Author and Date of Creation are considered system metadata because they describe the technical aspects of data, typically generated and managed automatically by the system or software handling the data. This metadata helps track the origin, creation time, and lifecycle of information, which is essential for data management, traceability, and system operations.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) Author, Owner
While “Author” is system metadata, “Owner” is generally a business or organizational attribute, not automatically generated by the system.

(B) Classification, Project, Owner
These are business process metadata, describing the context, meaning, and purpose of the data rather than its technical characteristics.

(D) Owner, Date of Creation, Permission
“Date of Creation” is system metadata, but “Owner” and “Permission” pertain more to business context and access control, not the system-generated technical properties.

Overall Explanation:
Metadata is “data about data” and can be categorized into system metadata and business process metadata. System metadata includes technical attributes like author, creation date, file format, and size, which are automatically managed by the system. Business process metadata provides contextual or operational information, like ownership, project association, or classification, which is generally assigned manually. Understanding this distinction is critical for proper data governance and lifecycle management.

12. While employed at a medium-sized enterprise, you are responsible for data classification. What is the foremost aspect to consider when formulating a Data Classification policy among the following options?

(A) The highest classification level must be "top-secret"

(B) Each classification level should have its own handling and destruction requirements

(C) All information should be tagged as "proprietary"

(D) The lowest classification level must be "public" and the highest should be "top-secret"

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer: (B)

Each classification level having its own handling and destruction requirements ensures that sensitive data is protected appropriately according to its sensitivity. This approach helps maintain confidentiality and integrity throughout the data lifecycle and ensures proper disposal of information based on its classification.

Incorrect Answers:

(A) The highest classification level must be "top-secret"
While having a “top-secret” level can be important for highly sensitive data, it is not the main focus. The key is defining clear handling and disposal requirements for all levels.

(C) All information should be tagged as "proprietary"
Tagging everything as “proprietary” does not create a structured classification system. Different levels of sensitivity require distinct security measures.

(D) The lowest classification level must be "public" and the highest should be "top-secret"
Although common, defining levels alone is not sufficient. The priority is specifying how each level should be handled and destroyed.

Overall Explanation:
Formulating a data classification policy is about tailoring protection and disposal procedures to the sensitivity of data. Different types of data demand different security measures. The classification levels themselves are secondary; the critical aspect is the operational handling, access, and destruction requirements that align with each classification. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure and is only accessible to authorized personnel.
