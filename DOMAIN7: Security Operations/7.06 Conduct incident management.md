## 7.6.1 Detection ##

Detection is often the first line of defense in incident management. Imagine a scenario where an intruder is lurking in your office building, moving through halls and corridors unnoticed. If you don’t have cameras, alarms, or someone actively monitoring, how long would it take to realize that there’s a breach? Similarly, in the digital world, detection is about identifying that a security event is occurring, or has already occurred, so that an organization can respond swiftly and minimize damage.

Detection refers to identifying signs of security incidents, including attacks, breaches, or anomalies in systems, networks, or applications.

:necktie: Detection is not just about finding out that something has happened—it’s about doing so quickly and accurately to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker.

The faster the detection, the quicker the response and recovery. Without a strong detection capability, the effectiveness of an organization’s incident management framework is compromised. Early detection saves money—it’s as simple as that. Think about it like finding a leak in a pipe before it bursts and floods the house. The earlier you can detect the issue, the less damage it will cause. According to studies by the Ponemon Institute, the cost per record of a breach can escalate significantly based on how long it takes to detect and contain the breach. Faster detection equates to fewer breached records, lower financial impact, and a reduced chance of reputational damage. Furthermore, improving detection mechanisms also empowers other critical incident response stages, such as containment and eradication. If detection is delayed or inaccurate, it can set off a chain reaction that makes it harder to recover from an incident and restore systems to their secure state.

:bulb: Detection is not a single tool—it’s an ecosystem. You shouldn't rely on one tool to protect your network. The following might help in incident detection:

| Concept | Description | Example / Key Point |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Logs and Events: The Raw Materials** | Logs are like aircraft black boxes: they record every click, packet, login, and configuration change. They’re only valuable if analyzed and correlated to reveal a meaningful story. | Example: A user logs in at 3:42 AM from Moscow, then at 3:45 AM from San Francisco. Without correlating geolocation and time, this “impossible travel” could be missed—an indicator of credential theft. |
| **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** | A SIEM tool collects logs from servers, firewalls, endpoints, etc., and analyzes them with rules, signatures, and machine learning. It identifies suspicious patterns but does not stop attacks directly. | Examples of alerts: five failed logins followed by a success, 20GB of data exfiltrated after hours, or a critical file accessed by someone without business need. The SIEM acts as the “brain,” pointing analysts to potential threats quickly. |
| **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** | IDS is passive—it monitors traffic and alerts on suspicious activity, unlike an IPS, which can also take action. IDS may be signature-based or anomaly-based, useful for spotting known attacks or deviations. | Example: Detecting a SQL injection string in HTTP traffic. Challenge: IDS often generates false positives, so tuning is essential. A well-tuned IDS is like a skilled guard dog—alert, but not barking at every squirrel. |

You’ll hear a lot about Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Attack (IOAs). Here’s the key difference:

**IOC:** Evidence that an attack has occurred. Think malware hash, known bad IP address, modified registry key.

**IOA:** Signs that an attack may be happening right now. Think abnormal login times, privilege escalation, or script execution in memory.

IOCs are like footprints in the mud. IOAs are like hearing footsteps upstairs when you know you’re alone.
Effective detection combines both. We want to catch attacks in progress (IOAs) while also looking for forensic evidence (IOCs) to understand what happened and who did it.

### Open Questions ###

1. Why is timely detection important in incident management, and how does it impact incident response?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Timely detection allows security teams to identify and respond to threats before significant damage occurs, reducing attacker dwell time. The faster an incident is detected, the higher the chance of containing it early and minimizing costs.
</details>

2. What does an Indicator of Attack (IOA) represent, and how is it different from an Indicator of Compromise (IOC)?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
An IOA signals suspicious behavior that may indicate an ongoing attack, such as unusual login times or rapid privilege escalation. In contrast, an IOC confirms that a system has already been compromised, like detecting a known malware signature or unauthorized registry change.
</details>

3. What is the main function of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system during the detection phase?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
A SIEM collects, correlates, and analyzes logs from multiple sources to detect patterns and generate alerts on suspicious activity. It helps analysts prioritize incidents based on severity and context, enabling faster and more informed responses.
</details>

4. In what way does an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) differ from an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
An IDS monitors and alerts on malicious activity but takes no action to stop it, while an IPS can block or prevent the traffic in real time. IDS is passive and used for monitoring, whereas IPS is active and used for prevention.
</details>

5. What are the risks associated with having poor tuning in your detection systems?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Poorly tuned detection systems can create excessive false positives, overwhelming analysts and leading to alert fatigue. Alternatively, too much filtering can suppress legitimate alerts, allowing real threats to go unnoticed.
