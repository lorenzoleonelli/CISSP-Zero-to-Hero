## Hard Questions ##

1. As a security engineer, you are tasked with making the active IDS function as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) while following best practices outlined in NIST SP 800-94. According to NIST SP 800-94, which of the following is a key requirement for making an active IDS function as an IPS?

A. It must be installed in the DMZ
B. It must be properly hardened
C. It must fail securely
D. It must be in line with the traffic

✅ Correct Answer: D. It must be in line with the traffic

An IDS can act as an IPS only if it is placed in-line with network traffic, allowing it to actively block or modify packets in real time. According to NIST SP 800-94, in-line placement is the defining requirement that transforms a passive detection system into an active prevention system.

IDS vs. IPS Placement:

IDS → Out-of-band (monitors traffic passively)

IPS → In-line (analyzes and blocks malicious traffic immediately)

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. It must be installed in the DMZ
Placement in the DMZ may enhance protection for public-facing systems, but it is not required for IDS-to-IPS conversion.

❌ B. It must be properly hardened
Hardening improves overall system security but does not determine IDS or IPS functionality.

❌ C. It must fail securely
Fail-secure mechanisms (fail-open or fail-closed) improve resilience but are not the key factor in enabling IPS behavior.

2. You are a security analyst conducting a risk assessment for a newly discovered vulnerability in your company's software. As part of your evaluation, you use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to determine the severity and potential impact of the vulnerability. CVSS provides various metrics to assess risk, but which of the following is NOT an area of concern in a CVSS assessment?

A. Base metrics for qualities intrinsic to a vulnerability
B. Environmental metrics for vulnerabilities that depend on a particular implementation or environment
C. Temporal metrics for characteristics that evolve over the lifetime of a vulnerability
D. International compliance metrics related to the vulnerability

✅ Correct Answer: D. International compliance metrics related to the vulnerability

Explanation:
CVSS does not evaluate compliance or regulatory factors. It focuses purely on the technical severity of a vulnerability, not on whether an organization meets international standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, or NIST.

CVSS Metric Groups:

Base Metrics: Intrinsic properties of a vulnerability (e.g., exploitability, impact).

Temporal Metrics: Factors that change over time (e.g., exploit availability, patch maturity).

Environmental Metrics: Contextual adjustments for a specific organization (e.g., existing controls, asset value).

Incorrect Answers:
❌ A. Base metrics — Measure inherent characteristics of a vulnerability.
❌ B. Environmental metrics — Adapt severity based on local conditions.
❌ C. Temporal metrics — Reflect time-dependent characteristics like available exploits.
