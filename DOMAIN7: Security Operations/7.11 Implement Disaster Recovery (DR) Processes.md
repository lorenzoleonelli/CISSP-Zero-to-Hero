## 7.11.1 Response ##

Emergency response is not the beginning of the incident—it’s the beginning of the organization’s defense. It is the first human-led moment in the disaster recovery process when we go from automated alerts and logs to action, leadership, and containment. When an event unfolds—be it a ransomware attack, a data breach, or a massive denial-of-service—the difference between escalation and recovery often lies in the speed, clarity, and confidence of the emergency response team. Emergency response is not improvisation. It is the execution of plans prepared long before the emergency ever happens. That planning is what turns chaos into procedure. But even the best plan is only as strong as the people and training behind it. The goal of emergency response is not just to stop the damage—it’s to create space for informed decision-making, to protect assets and people, and to keep the organization functioning even as systems fail.

Imagine a building catches fire. The fire itself is the incident. The emergency response is everything that happens from the moment the fire alarm rings—the evacuation, the alerting of firefighters, the switching on of fire suppression systems. In cybersecurity, the same principle applies. When an attack hits, the alarms are digital—an intrusion detection system flags unauthorized access, log files show privilege escalation, or network monitoring tools notice an unusual data outflow. That’s the alarm. The response begins with human decisions: who is notified, what is shut down, what is escalated, and what communication begins internally. In well-prepared organizations, this is immediate. There’s a 24/7 incident response number. The on-call cybersecurity lead is paged. A virtual war room is spun up. But in unprepared environments, it’s panic, confusion, and delays—sometimes hours of paralysis.

What makes a good emergency response? First, it’s **speed**, but not speed for speed’s sake. It’s decisive, structured speed. The first responder might isolate a server, disconnect a device, or revoke credentials. But they do it according to the playbook. They don’t just unplug cables randomly; they follow containment protocols. Why? Because overreaction can cause more damage than the attack. I’ve seen teams pull the plug on entire data centers only to find out the alert was a false positive, or worse, trigger a ransomware payload because they terminated the wrong process. Emergency response is precise. It’s what you practice in peacetime so you can act with muscle memory during crisis.

The second pillar of emergency response is **coordination**. It doesn’t happen in a silo. The response lead needs to communicate in real time with system owners, legal counsel, possibly even law enforcement. This is why every second counts. Time is not just money—it’s evidence, reputational risk, and business continuity. In many ransomware attacks, for example, the difference between containing a few machines and losing the entire domain is just a matter of minutes. Without predefined roles, escalation paths, and contact lists, response time slows. So the emergency response plan must be specific: who leads the response? Who has the authority to shut down systems? Who contacts executives or invokes DR procedures? These decisions must be made in advance, not in the middle of the storm.

Now consider the **emotional and cognitive state of your responders**. A cybersecurity emergency isn’t just technical—it’s stressful. People make mistakes when they’re tired, frightened, or unsure of their authority. A good emergency response plan accounts for this. It trains people in high-pressure decision-making. It builds in fallback positions—if the lead responder is unavailable, who takes over? If remote access is cut off, how do they reach the systems? It even anticipates lockdowns or natural disasters that prevent people from physically accessing data centers or offices. This is where tabletop exercises and simulations become invaluable. They aren’t just check-the-box compliance activities—they’re rehearsal for real-world emergencies, and they help uncover gaps that only become visible under pressure.

Emergency response is also your organization’s first line of **communication** with the outside world. Before legal and PR teams get involved, the responders may be the ones who speak to partners, vendors, or even law enforcement. This is why message discipline is critical. Say too much, and you may create liability or panic. Say too little, and you may lose trust. Good responders know how to say, “We are aware of an issue, we are investigating, and we will provide updates,” without speculating. This kind of communication can prevent lawsuits, stock drops, or regulator involvement—just because it gives people the sense that the organization is in control.

:necktie: Every organization assumes that prevention will eventually fail. That’s not pessimism—that’s realistic risk management.

What happens in the first minutes of an incident can decide whether the next six months are spent in courtrooms and crisis management—or in quiet lessons learned and improved resilience. Emergency response plays that deciding role.

## 7.11.2 Personnel ##

When disaster strikes, technologies can fail, infrastructures can collapse, but what ultimately determines whether a business survives the crisis is its people. In any disaster recovery process, personnel are not just resources—they are the operators, the coordinators, the decision-makers, and in many cases, the heroes of the recovery. A well-designed DR plan that doesn't account for the human element is as useful as a fire escape plan that forgets to tell people where the stairs are. Understanding personnel in the DR process means looking at both the strategic assignment of roles and the human realities that unfold under pressure. 

:necktie: One of the most important things to clarify early is: who does what. During an emergency, ambiguity is deadly. 

Everyone involved must know their specific responsibilities—who activates the recovery site, who communicates with vendors, who ensures critical applications are brought back online, who talks to the press, and who leads the investigation. These roles must be documented, practiced, and, critically, redundant. Why redundant? Because people go on vacation, get stuck in traffic, fall sick, or might themselves be impacted by the disaster. That’s why you need alternates for every role and why the DR plan must include a human fallback plan as much as a technical one. Real resilience isn't about having one superstar incident responder—it's about having a team where everyone knows their part and can step up if needed.

In planning for personnel, you also have to think about access. If your lead database administrator is on call during a cyberattack but doesn’t have secure remote access to the data center or cloud environment, they might as well be offline. Credentials, tokens, VPNs, and even physical keys must be accounted for in the DR plan. It’s not just who should act, but how they can act when it counts. And access must be pre-approved and exercised in drills. You don’t want your DR process to be held up while someone’s waiting for an account to be unlocked. And this leads to another critical point: when assigning roles, don’t forget about stress. People perform differently under pressure, and not everyone is built to make high-stakes decisions in the heat of a crisis. This is why rehearsals and tabletop exercises are not just compliance checks—they are psychological training. They let you see who stays calm, who panics, who leads effectively, and who needs a different kind of role. A well-balanced DR team combines technical skill with emotional resilience. It blends the silent fixer with the vocal coordinator. It knows when to move fast and when to slow down to think. This is people strategy in action, not just tech management.

During a real disaster, personnel are also tasked with upholding one of the most fragile yet vital assets: trust. Whether it’s with employees, customers, partners, or regulators, your personnel are the face of the organization’s response. If someone picks up the phone and says the wrong thing—like, “we don’t know what’s going on” or “it’s probably fine”—that can damage your reputation more than the breach itself. So communication roles must be carefully assigned. Who speaks externally? Who updates executives? Who handles regulators? And these people must be trained not just in what to say but how to say it—measured, calm, factual. In high-pressure situations, the wrong tone can cause more harm than no message at all.

Personnel planning must also consider continuity beyond the crisis. Once the immediate emergency is stabilized, who ensures operations resume? Who validates the restored systems, checks for backdoors, or oversees post-restoration audits? Who coordinates with HR if layoffs or restructuring result from the disaster’s financial impact? Disaster recovery doesn’t stop when the systems boot up again—it includes emotional and organizational recovery. People must be cared for, supported, and re-engaged. If you burn out your top cybersecurity engineers during a crisis and then leave them unsupported, you may survive the disaster but lose your talent. This is why modern DR planning includes not just roles but also recovery for the responders—psychological support, recognition, and review.

:necktie: Technology can’t replace the need for organized, trained, and empowered personnel. The best firewall won’t help if the wrong server gets reimaged. The fastest backup won’t help if nobody knows how to restore it. And the best DR plan won’t work if the people it relies on aren’t ready. So study the tools, yes—but master the people part. 

## 7.11.3 Communication ##

When a disaster hits, the speed and accuracy with which you communicate can mean the difference between chaos and coordination. Communication in a disaster recovery context is not just about making announcements—it is about creating a structured, resilient channel through which facts, decisions, and instructions flow smoothly under pressure. The problem in most organizations isn’t that no one communicates, it’s that everyone communicates in their own way, without clarity about what to say, whom to inform, or what medium to use. And during a crisis, that ambiguity can be fatal. 

:necktie: Think of communication like the nervous system of your DR plan. It connects decision-makers to responders, responders to users, users to leadership, and the entire organization to the outside world.

The first step is **defining audiences**. You’re not communicating to one monolithic group—you have internal staff, IT teams, executive leadership, customers, regulators, the media, and possibly even law enforcement. Each of these groups needs different messages, at different times, through different formats. Your internal team needs actionable status updates. Leadership needs impact analysis and options. Regulators want compliance updates. Customers want transparency and reassurance. And the media—well, they want a story, and if you don’t give them the right one, they might write their own. One of the most damaging errors in cybersecurity incidents is silence. In the absence of communication, speculation spreads. Imagine a ransomware attack locking up your systems. You’re still assessing the situation, but rumors on social media claim you're hiding the breach. Now your technical crisis becomes a reputational one. This is why proactive, transparent, and truthful communication is a core part of disaster containment.

Next comes **medium**. What if the email system is what’s down? Do you fall back to Slack? SMS? Satellite phone? A well-designed DR communication plan includes multiple communication trees—secure phone numbers, encrypted apps, cloud-hosted contact lists, even physical communication kits if all else fails. One real-world example comes from a hospital group that suffered a total IT blackout due to a cyberattack. Their emergency communications included two-way radios, paper-based logs, and runners—yes, people physically running across buildings delivering messages. They managed to continue delivering patient care and restoring systems, because the communication plan had redundancy and training built-in.

But communication isn’t only about infrastructure—it’s also about tone, timing, and truth. How do you notify staff about a breach without creating panic? How do you update leadership in a way that informs but doesn’t paralyze? How do you maintain public trust while complying with legal disclosure timelines? These aren’t just PR questions—they are security questions. Every word spoken during a DR event becomes part of your risk landscape. A rushed statement could hint at vulnerabilities. A vague update could erode trust. A delay could imply negligence. That’s why your communication team must include security-literate members—people who understand not only what happened, but what can and cannot be said from a legal and strategic standpoint.

:bulb: During the exam, and in the real world, always consider whether your communication strategy supports confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Are messages authenticated? Are logs preserved? Are channels encrypted? Can communication still happen during an outage? These are questions a security professional must ask—not just an IT or PR person. Communication is as much a part of your security posture as your firewall configuration.

Finally, effective communication is something you train and drill, not just plan on paper. Tabletop exercises should simulate not only technical recovery but also communication under stress. Test the chain of command. Test the clarity of messages. Test whether your alternate channels actually work. Because when the real event happens, there will be no time to scroll through a policy document hunting for the CEO’s direct number or the pre-approved press statement. You’ll need to act, speak, inform, and lead—in real time. And for that, communication must be not just a checkbox in your DR plan, but a living capability embedded in your culture.

The following table recaps the concepts seen so far:

| **Aspect**                               | **Key Points**                                                                                                             | **Example / Implication**                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Tone, Timing, and Truth**              | Communication must balance transparency, calmness, and legality.                                                           | A rushed statement may expose vulnerabilities; a delayed one may appear negligent.                                                      |
| **Security-Literate Communicators**      | Include people who understand technical and legal limits of what can be disclosed.                                         | Security-aware communicators prevent leaks of sensitive details or noncompliant statements.                                             |

## 7.11.4 Assessment ##

Assessment is the heartbeat of any disaster recovery (DR) process. It's the moment when you pause, take a breath, and ask: What just happened? How bad is it? What do we need to do next?

:necktie: Without a thorough assessment, you're essentially navigating a storm without a compass. In the realm of cybersecurity, where threats evolve rapidly, a structured assessment ensures that responses are not just reactive but strategic.

Assessment in DR encompasses several key components. First, there's the identification of affected assets. This involves determining which systems, applications, and data have been impacted. Next is evaluating the severity of the incident. Is it a localized issue, or does it have broader implications? Understanding the scope helps prioritize recovery efforts. Then, there's the root cause analysis. Identifying how the incident occurred is crucial to prevent recurrence. Finally, assessment involves gauging the effectiveness of the initial response. Were protocols followed? Were there any bottlenecks or miscommunications?

Assessment isn't a one-time activity; it's continuous. Post-incident reviews, regular audits, and simulations are all part of an ongoing assessment strategy. These activities help organizations stay prepared and adapt to new threats. For instance, conducting tabletop exercises can reveal gaps in communication or decision-making processes, allowing for improvements before a real incident occurs.

:link: Incorporating assessment into the DR process also aligns with frameworks like [NIST SP 800-34](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-sp-800-34), which emphasizes the importance of contingency planning and regular evaluations. By adhering to such standards, organizations not only enhance their resilience but also demonstrate compliance with industry best practices.

## 7.11.5 Restoration ##

Restoration is the phase where we begin the journey back to normal, and for many cybersecurity professionals, it is both the most satisfying and the most treacherous part of disaster recovery. After the dust settles and the systems stop screaming, after the emergency response and assessment are complete, the focus shifts toward rebuilding and bringing systems, data, and operations back online. But make no mistake—restoration isn’t just about flipping the switch back on. It’s about doing it in a way that ensures integrity, stability, and security. 

:necktie: One of the biggest mistakes organizations make is rushing restoration to meet business demands, skipping crucial checks that might expose them to further harm. In cybersecurity, that’s like rebuilding the front door but leaving the back door wide open. Restoration begins with prioritization.

Not all systems need to be restored at the same time. Critical systems—those supporting life-saving operations in a hospital or financial transactions in a bank—must come first. This prioritization is typically defined during the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and mapped out in the disaster recovery plan. Restoration isn’t random; it follows a playbook designed during calmer times when clear heads prevailed.

Then comes **validation**. Every restored system must be tested. Has it been fully cleansed of malware? Are configurations secure? Is the latest data intact and not corrupted? This step often reveals hidden issues—perhaps a configuration drift, perhaps a dependency on a system that wasn’t restored yet. At this stage, restoration teams work hand-in-hand with cybersecurity to ensure no remnants of the breach or outage persist. Cybersecurity is not a passive observer in restoration; it’s actively engaged in forensic validation, patch management, and ensuring restored systems don’t repeat the vulnerabilities of the past. In IT terms, restoration might involve moving services to a hardened cloud environment, improving access controls, or segmenting networks. You’re not just rebuilding—you’re improving. 

Another key concept is **phased restoration**. Bringing everything online at once can lead to overloads, missed dependencies, and cascading failures. Instead, restoration should be staged—system by system, priority by priority—each phase validated and stabilized before moving on. This is where restoration intersects with high availability. If your architecture includes redundant systems, failover environments, or cloud-based scaling, restoration might be smoother. But it still requires coordination, communication, and clarity. One often-overlooked element is data integrity. Backups are useless if the data is outdated, corrupt, or incomplete. Before restoring data, teams must validate it—ensure no malware lies dormant, ensure data consistency, and align it with business needs. Restoration is not just a technical task—it’s a business-critical operation. Stakeholders must be informed of what’s restored, what’s next, and what can be expected. Sometimes, restoration brings surprises: perhaps a system was more critical than assumed, perhaps a backup was missing, or perhaps users now demand features that didn’t exist before. This is where restoration becomes a learning process. And speaking of learning, restoration is deeply tied to the culture of preparedness. Organizations that practice restoration via regular drills, tabletop exercises, and test recoveries tend to restore faster, with less damage. They know their dependencies, their gaps, and their limits. Those that treat restoration as a theoretical exercise often discover in crisis that the real world doesn’t follow the plan. 

## 7.11.6 Training and Awareness ##

Training and awareness are the living, breathing heart of a disaster recovery process. You can have the best recovery plan in the world, written by brilliant minds, backed by cutting-edge technology—but if your people don’t know what to do when the lights go out, your plan will fail. It's not the plan itself that matters most in the chaos of a real incident, but the readiness of the people who have to carry it out. And that readiness comes only from repeated, practical, thoughtful training. Think of it like a fire drill. Everyone’s seen the evacuation plan pinned up in the hallway, but it’s not until you’ve walked down the stairwell and assembled in the parking lot during a drill that you really start to understand what’s expected of you. The same principle applies to disaster recovery. If employees haven’t practiced their roles under stress, they’ll either freeze or improvise in dangerous ways—and in cybersecurity, improvisation during crisis can cause more damage than the original incident. Training goes far beyond IT staff. Every department—from legal to finance, HR to sales—has a role in recovery, even if it’s just understanding how to continue operations using alternate communication methods or how to access restored systems. For example, if the main CRM system goes down and is replaced by a failover system in another region, will sales staff know how to access it? Will support teams know which version of the customer data is current? These aren’t just technical questions; they are practical, operational ones—and only well-trained staff will handle them smoothly.

Effective training must be realistic, role-specific, and continuous. It should mirror the types of disasters the organization is most likely to face—power outages, ransomware attacks, supply chain failures, DDoS incidents, or natural disasters. We don't train people to memorize policies; we train them to think under pressure, to know their roles without second-guessing, to trust their preparation. Realistic scenario-based exercises—whether full-scale drills or tabletop simulations—help surface the friction points. These are the places where theory and reality diverge. Maybe your recovery communication plan assumes mobile phones will be operational, but your exercise shows that cellular service fails during a regional disaster. Maybe your employees assume IT will fix everything, but the training shows them that business unit leaders must make crucial prioritization decisions. These exercises are where you identify those gaps—not during a real-world crisis.

Awareness complements training by building a security culture. It ensures that everyone—from the CEO to the interns—understands the importance of disaster readiness. Awareness campaigns might include posters, short quizzes, incident newsletters, or updates after every test. You’re creating a mindset: “Be ready, be informed, be part of the solution.” In a way, awareness is the quiet background music that reinforces the lessons learned in training. Without awareness, people forget. With it, they retain and apply knowledge more naturally. And just like training, awareness should be continuous. If you teach people once and never revisit it, they’ll lose the edge. Imagine if airline pilots only trained once on emergency landings when they were hired. Ridiculous, right? The same goes for cybersecurity and DR. People need refreshers. They need reminders. And they need updates when the plan changes.

:necktie: Training and awareness must be tracked. Not just for compliance, but for assurance. You need to know who completed which training, who performed well during exercises, and who may need additional support. This is especially true in regulated industries, where auditors want to see proof that your DR plan isn’t just a document, but a living process tested and practiced across the organization.

## 7.11.7 Lessons Learned ##

Lessons learned is not just the final step in a disaster recovery process—it is the bridge to maturity, the mechanism by which an organization evolves from simply surviving an incident to actually growing stronger because of it. Too often, organizations treat recovery as the finish line, exhaling in relief once services are back online and data has been restored. But for those who understand resilience at a deeper level, the real value begins after the dust settles. This is where we extract insights, refine processes, close gaps, and prepare for what’s next. Think of it like a post-game review in professional sports. No serious team skips the replay. They break down plays, analyze what worked, what failed, and what must change before the next match. That’s exactly what the lessons learned process is about. It's where you shift from crisis mode to learning mode. It's where temporary patches become permanent fixes and where you gain the wisdom that no tabletop exercise can fully simulate.
The importance of this step becomes obvious once you understand how blind most teams are during a disaster. Even with the best planning, incidents tend to expose the cracks between departments, the untested assumptions, the human factors that never made it into the documentation. For example, you might discover that a critical vendor wasn’t reachable because their contact information hadn’t been updated in years. Or you might find out that your incident response team spent twenty minutes debating whether a recovery step was authorized because the documentation used vague language like "senior IT manager" instead of naming the specific role. These are the kinds of operational friction points that only emerge under real pressure. If you don't capture them immediately afterward, they fade into memory and eventually repeat. And repeated mistakes in cybersecurity tend to get more expensive each time.
Conducting a lessons learned review isn't just about gathering complaints—it's a structured, thoughtful analysis of what happened and why. This includes timeline reviews, role debriefs, communication audits, technology evaluations, and procedural breakdowns. It’s about asking questions that matter: Where did the plan support us, and where did it fail us? Were there moments of improvisation that succeeded and should now be standardized? Did human behavior align with the training we gave, or did people react differently than expected? Were the escalation paths clear, and did decision-makers have the information they needed at the right times? These questions don’t just serve postmortem purposes—they directly influence policy updates, training modules, control designs, and even budgeting decisions. In fact, some of the most convincing business cases for security investments are born in lessons learned reports. When executives read that a six-hour delay in data recovery cost the company $180,000 in lost revenue, they are far more inclined to approve funding for a better backup solution or a faster recovery site.
One of the most overlooked values of lessons learned is the morale and cultural impact. It gives people a voice after the chaos. When teams are invited to reflect on the incident, to speak about what they experienced and suggest improvements, it promotes ownership and transparency. This is especially powerful when leadership listens and acts on that feedback. It shifts the tone from blame to collaboration. Rather than pointing fingers, the organization is saying: “We all went through this. Now let’s grow from it together.” In this sense, lessons learned is not just a technical exercise—it’s a people strategy. And in security, where user behavior often determines success or failure, culture matters more than most people realize
A good practice is to capture lessons learned in a centralized repository. This way, insights from past incidents become institutional memory rather than tribal knowledge. New employees can review them during onboarding, teams can refer to them during annual reviews, and auditors can see the organization’s commitment to continuous improvement. Better yet, these reports should influence the next round of risk assessments. If three incidents in the past year were caused by weak vendor coordination, that pattern should directly inform your vendor risk management strategy going forward. In this way, lessons learned isn’t a passive report—it’s a feedback loop that drives the next cycle of planning, preparedness, and prevention.

Here’s a simple table to recap the flow and value of a lessons learned process in a disaster recovery context:

| **Step in the Process**        | **Purpose**                                           | **Outcome**                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Review**            | Reconstruct the timeline and facts                    | Establish what happened and when                        |
| **Stakeholder Debriefs**       | Gather role-specific feedback and experiences         | Identify operational friction and human factor insights |
| **Root Cause Analysis**        | Understand underlying issues                          | Reveal system or process failures                       |
| **Recommendation Development** | Propose policy, procedural, or technical improvements | Feed future planning and training initiatives           |
| **Dissemination & Ownership**  | Share findings and assign follow-up tasks             | Ensure accountability and cross-functional alignment    |
| **Documentation & Retention**  | Create a knowledge base of past incidents             | Promote organizational learning and audit readiness     |



:necktie: Security is not just about prevention—it’s about resilience. Incidents will happen. What defines a mature organization is not whether it avoids every problem, but how it responds and learns from them

3. What is the role of communication during a disaster, and why must both internal and external channels be addressed in the DR strategy?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Communication is the backbone of crisis coordination. Internally, it aligns technical teams, management, and staff. Externally, it provides accurate updates to customers, regulators, and vendors. Without a clear plan, misinformation can spread, damaging trust and causing delays. </details>

4. In the context of DR, how should an organization conduct an effective post-incident assessment?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An effective assessment involves analyzing the incident’s root causes, affected systems, business impact, and response effectiveness. It should be data-driven and impartial, using logs, timelines, and feedback to guide decisions on process improvements and risk mitigation. </details>

5. What are the key challenges organizations face during the restoration phase, and how can planning mitigate them?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Restoration often involves recovering data, reconfiguring systems, and verifying integrity and availability. Common challenges include hardware shortages, incomplete backups, or incompatibility issues. Planning for these in advance, with vendor agreements and restoration playbooks, can minimize disruption. </details>

6. Why should training and awareness be considered continuous activities rather than one-time tasks in a DR program?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Threats evolve and staff change. Regular training ensures that all employees are familiar with current threats, tools, and protocols. Awareness campaigns also reduce human error, which is a common cause of breaches and failed recoveries. </details>

7. How do tabletop exercises and simulation drills contribute to disaster preparedness in real-world scenarios?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Tabletop and live simulation exercises expose gaps in plans and reveal misunderstandings in roles or communication paths. They build muscle memory and confidence, making the actual response more fluid and effective when a real incident occurs. </details>

8. What makes the "lessons learned" phase essential for improving future DR plans, and how should it be documented?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> "Lessons learned" turn failures and successes into institutional knowledge. They should be documented in after-action reports and integrated into updated policies, training sessions, and future DR tests to prevent recurrence of the same mistakes. </details>

9. How do you ensure that all stakeholders—including non-technical staff—understand their responsibilities during a disaster?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Clear documentation, role cards, and regular awareness sessions can empower non-technical staff. Including them in training exercises helps ensure that everyone—from receptionists to executives—knows what to do, whom to contact, and how to stay safe and effective during a crisis. </details>

10. What are the consequences of failing to integrate the full DR cycle into the broader business continuity strategy?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> If DR is isolated from the larger business continuity strategy, recovery efforts may be technically sound but misaligned with business priorities. This can lead to wasted effort, missed SLAs, and a failure to protect critical business functions when they’re needed most. </details>
