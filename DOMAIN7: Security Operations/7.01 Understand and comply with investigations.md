## 7.1.0 Preface ##

In cybersecurity, sooner or later you'll face a situation where an investigation is needed. Whether it’s a data breach, insider misuse, policy violation, or external attack, understanding the purpose and type of the investigation is crucial for gathering evidence properly, protecting your organization, and staying compliant with the law.

There are three main types of investigations you’ll come across:

| Investigation Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Administrative Investigations | Sometimes called operational or internal, these are run by organizations to enforce their own internal rules, policies, and security standards. The focus isn’t necessarily on criminal charges but on ensuring employees, vendors, or contractors follow company policies, code of conduct, or employment agreements. The goal is to find out if rules were broken and take action — such as retraining the employee, firing them, or strengthening weak processes. Evidence collected may stay internal unless the issue escalates into a civil lawsuit or criminal case. Chain of custody is important, but the process is typically faster and less formal than in criminal or civil cases. |
| Criminal Investigations       | Focus on detecting, proving, and prosecuting violations of the law. Conducted by police, federal agencies, and prosecutors, with strict rules around evidence collection, chain of custody, and legal procedures. Evidence must meet criminal court standards: reliable, complete, and collected without violating rights. Most criminal cases must meet the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. Examples include hacking, ransomware, fraud, identity theft, or unauthorized data breaches. Cybersecurity professionals supporting these cases must avoid contaminating evidence and work alongside law enforcement.                                                                         |
| Civil Investigations          | Happen when an organization or individual seeks compensation or resolution rather than punishment. Common in business conflicts, intellectual property theft, breach of contract, or cases requiring quantification of damages. The burden of proof is lower than in criminal cases (usually "preponderance of the evidence"). Evidence handling still matters, especially for court presentation. Cybersecurity experts may gather logs, snapshots, or system records to support claims, such as vendor misuse of customer data or licensing violations.                                                                                                                                       |

We can recap the investigation types as follows:

| Investigation Type           | Purpose                                | Who Handles It                     | Evidence Usage                   | Example Scenario                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Administrative / Operational | Enforce internal rules and policies    | Internal security / HR / legal     | Internal (may escalate to legal) | Employee violates data handling policy |
| Criminal                     | Prove violation of criminal law        | Law enforcement, prosecutors       | Must meet strict legal standards | Ransomware attack or system intrusion  |
| Civil                        | Resolve disputes and seek compensation | Legal teams, private investigators | Used in court for damages        | Vendor steals proprietary source code  |

:bulb: Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is a specialized field within cybersecurity focused on identifying, investigating, and mitigating security incidents. Digital forensics involves collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence from systems, networks, and devices to understand how an incident occurred and who was responsible. Incident Response (IR) focuses on detecting threats in real-time, containing breaches, and recovering business operations while minimizing damage. Together, DFIR helps organizations strengthen security postures and supports legal and regulatory actions after cyber incidents.

:link: EDRM (Electronic Discovery Reference Model) is a framework that guides how digital evidence is identified, preserved, collected, and presented during legal investigations and court cases.
It helps organizations handle electronically stored information (ESI) in a structured way — making sure nothing is lost, tampered with, or misinterpreted.
The EDRM process typically follows these stages:
Information Governance – Organize and manage data before any legal action.
Identification – Find potentially relevant data.
Preservation – Protect data from alteration or deletion.
Collection – Gather the preserved data securely.
Processing – Filter and prepare data for review.
Review – Analyze the data for relevance and legal privilege.
Analysis – Understand patterns, timelines, and facts.
Production – Share the data with opposing counsel or the court.
Presentation – Use the data as evidence in legal proceedings.

### Open Questions ###

What is the main purpose of administrative investigations in cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Administrative investigations aim to enforce an organization’s internal rules, policies, and security standards. They focus on ensuring that employees, vendors, or contractors comply with company policies and take action if rules are broken, such as retraining, disciplinary measures, or improving weak processes. </details>

How do criminal investigations differ from administrative investigations?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Criminal investigations focus on detecting, proving, and prosecuting violations of the law, often conducted by law enforcement or prosecutors. They follow strict rules for evidence collection and chain of custody and must meet the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard, unlike administrative investigations which are internal and less formal. </details>

What is the purpose of civil investigations in cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Civil investigations aim to resolve disputes or seek compensation rather than punish offenders. They are common in cases like intellectual property theft, breach of contract, or vendor misuse of data, and the burden of proof is usually lower than in criminal cases. </details>

Who typically handles each type of investigation: administrative, criminal, and civil?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Administrative investigations are handled by internal security, HR, or legal teams. Criminal investigations are conducted by law enforcement and prosecutors. Civil investigations are managed by legal teams or private investigators. </details>

What is the role of digital forensics in cybersecurity investigations?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Digital forensics involves collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence from systems, networks, and devices to understand how an incident occurred, who was responsible, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. </details>

How does incident response (IR) complement digital forensics?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Incident response focuses on detecting threats in real-time, containing breaches, and restoring operations while minimizing damage. Combined with digital forensics, it helps organizations respond quickly to incidents and supports legal or regulatory investigations. </details>

What is the purpose of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM)?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> EDRM provides a structured framework for handling electronically stored information (ESI) during legal investigations. It ensures that data is properly identified, preserved, collected, processed, reviewed, analyzed, produced, and presented as evidence in court. </details>

What are the main stages of the EDRM process?
