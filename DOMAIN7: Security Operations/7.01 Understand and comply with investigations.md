## 7.1.0 Preface ##

In cybersecurity, sooner or later you'll face a situation where an investigation is needed. Whether it’s a data breach, insider misuse, policy violation, or external attack, understanding the purpose and type of the investigation is crucial for gathering evidence properly, protecting your organization, and staying compliant with the law.

There are three main types of investigations you’ll come across:

| Investigation Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Administrative Investigations | Sometimes called **operational** or **internal**, these are run by organizations to enforce their own internal rules, policies, and security standards. The focus isn’t necessarily on criminal charges but on ensuring employees, vendors, or contractors follow company policies, code of conduct, or employment agreements. The goal is to find out if rules were broken and take action — such as retraining the employee, firing them, or strengthening weak processes. Evidence collected may stay internal unless the issue escalates into a civil lawsuit or criminal case. Chain of custody is important, but the process is typically faster and less formal than in criminal or civil cases. |
| Criminal Investigations       | Focus on detecting, proving, and prosecuting violations of the law. Conducted by police, federal agencies, and prosecutors, with strict rules around evidence collection, chain of custody, and legal procedures. Evidence must meet criminal court standards: reliable, complete, and collected without violating rights. Most criminal cases must meet the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. Examples include hacking, ransomware, fraud, identity theft, or unauthorized data breaches. Cybersecurity professionals supporting these cases must avoid contaminating evidence and work alongside law enforcement.                                                                         |
| Civil Investigations          | Happen when an organization or individual seeks compensation or resolution rather than punishment. Common in business conflicts, intellectual property theft, breach of contract, or cases requiring quantification of damages. The burden of proof is lower than in criminal cases (usually "preponderance of the evidence"). Evidence handling still matters, especially for court presentation. Cybersecurity experts may gather logs, snapshots, or system records to support claims, such as vendor misuse of customer data or licensing violations.                                                                                                                                       |

We can recap the investigation types as follows:

| Investigation Type           | Purpose                                | Who Handles It                     | Evidence Usage                   | Example Scenario                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Administrative / Operational | Enforce internal rules and policies    | Internal security / HR / legal     | Internal (may escalate to legal) | Employee violates data handling policy |
| Criminal                     | Prove violation of criminal law        | Law enforcement, prosecutors       | Must meet strict legal standards | Ransomware attack or system intrusion  |
| Civil                        | Resolve disputes and seek compensation | Legal teams, private investigators | Used in court for damages        | Vendor steals proprietary source code  |

:bulb: **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** is a specialized field within cybersecurity focused on identifying, investigating, and mitigating security incidents. Digital forensics involves collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence from systems, networks, and devices to understand how an incident occurred and who was responsible. Incident Response (IR) focuses on detecting threats in real-time, containing breaches, and recovering business operations while minimizing damage. Together, DFIR helps organizations strengthen security postures and supports legal and regulatory actions after cyber incidents.

:link: **EDRM (Electronic Discovery Reference Model)** is a framework that guides how digital evidence is identified, preserved, collected, and presented during legal investigations and court cases.
It helps organizations handle **electronically stored information (ESI)** in a structured way — making sure nothing is lost, tampered with, or misinterpreted.
The EDRM process typically follows these stages:

- Information Governance: Organize and manage data before any legal action.
  
- Identification: Find potentially relevant data.
  
- Preservation: Protect data from alteration or deletion.
  
- Collection: Gather the preserved data securely.
  
- Processing: Filter and prepare data for review.
  
- Review: Analyze the data for relevance and legal privilege.
  
- Analysis: Understand patterns, timelines, and facts.
  
- Production: Share the data with opposing counsel or the court.
  
- Presentation: Use the data as evidence in legal proceedings.

## 7.1.1 Evidence collection and handling ##

When it comes to cybersecurity investigations, evidence collection and handling are the foundation of any solid case, whether it's for an internal administrative review, a civil lawsuit, or criminal prosecution. Understanding the types of evidence, the rules that make evidence admissible in court, and the best practices for handling digital evidence is essential for incident responders, forensic analysts, and cybersecurity professionals.

The types of evidences we may deal with are:
1. **Real Evidence.** Real evidence refers to physical objects involved in the incident. In cybersecurity, this can include hard drives, USB devices, network appliances, printed documents, and even physical security items like keycards or surveillance recordings. These items must be carefully preserved and documented, as they can directly prove or disprove a claim.
2. **Documentary Evidence.** Documentary evidence includes any written or recorded material. In digital investigations, this typically involves logs, emails, system configuration files, contracts, policies, screenshots, and reports. Two important rules apply to documentary evidence:
  - Best Evidence Rule: Whenever possible, the original document should be presented rather than a copy. In digital forensics, this means collecting bit-by-bit forensic images instead of simple file copies, and maintaining the original data intact.
  - Parol Evidence Rule: When a written agreement exists, no oral or implied evidence is allowed to contradict or supplement the written terms. For example, in cases involving service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts, the terms written in the document take precedence over verbal claims.
3. **Testimonial Evidence.** Testimonial evidence is a statement or oral testimony given by witnesses. This could be an employee's explanation of their actions during an incident or an expert witness interpreting technical details in court. While testimonial evidence can support or clarify other evidence, it is often considered weaker due to human memory limitations and potential bias.
4. **Demonstrative Evidence.** Demonstrative evidence helps illustrate or explain other evidence. It could be diagrams, charts, timelines, forensic reconstructions, or video animations that depict how a cyberattack unfolded or where a system was vulnerable.

| Evidence Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                       | Notes / Key Points                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real Evidence          | Physical objects involved in the incident. Examples: hard drives, USB devices, network appliances, printed documents, keycards, surveillance recordings.          | Must be carefully preserved and documented as they directly prove or disprove a claim.                                                                              |
| Documentary Evidence   | Written or recorded material. Examples: logs, emails, system configuration files, contracts, policies, screenshots, reports.                                      | **Best Evidence Rule:** Collect original documents (bit-by-bit forensic images). <br> **Parol Evidence Rule:** Written agreements take precedence over oral claims. |
| Testimonial Evidence   | Statements or oral testimony from witnesses. Examples: employee explanations, expert witness interpretations.                                                     | Supports or clarifies other evidence but may be weaker due to human memory limitations and potential bias.                                                          |
| Demonstrative Evidence | Illustrates or explains other evidence. Examples: diagrams, charts, timelines, forensic reconstructions, video animations showing attack flow or vulnerabilities. | Helps the audience understand complex evidence or attack scenarios; used to complement other evidence types.                                                        |

:link: [NIST SP 800-86](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/86/final) is intended to help organizations in investigating computer security incidents and troubleshooting some information technology (IT) operational problems by providing practical guidance on performing computer and network forensics

For evidence to be accepted in a legal context, it must meet three primary criteria:
- **Relevance:** The evidence must have a direct connection to the case or incident.
- **Materiality:** The evidence must have significant importance to the matter under investigation.
- **Competence:** The evidence must be collected legally and handled properly according to established procedures. Any evidence obtained without appropriate authorization, or in a way that compromises its integrity, may be considered inadmissible.

Maintaining a clear, well-documented chain of custody is crucial for the integrity and admissibility of evidence. The chain of custody tracks the life cycle of a piece of evidence from the moment it is discovered until its final presentation in court or resolution.

The chain of custody should include:
- Who collected the evidence.
- When and where it was collected.
- How it was collected.
- How it was stored and protected.
- Every transfer or handoff, including time, date, and the individuals involved.

Breaking the chain of custody, or failing to document a handoff, can result in the evidence being excluded from court proceedings.

In legal terms, **hearsay** refers to "an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted." Generally, hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies. For example, system logs can sometimes be considered hearsay unless you can demonstrate their authenticity through metadata, audit trails, or corroboration from a qualified custodian.
Incident response teams should always be mindful of this rule when preparing evidence for possible legal action. Clear documentation and integrity verification help prevent issues related to hearsay.

In general, Incident Response Best Practices for Evidence Handling can be summed up as:

## 7.1.2 Reporting and documentation ##

When you think about evidence in a cybersecurity investigation, most people picture hard drives, logs, packet captures, or screenshots. But evidence alone isn't enough to win a case, convince stakeholders, or even make an incident report worth reading. What separates "raw data" from "court-ready proof" is how you report it, document it, and stand behind it. In many ways, the story you tell through evidence is as important as the data itself.

As a cybersecurity professional, your future will involve more than simply identifying technical clues. You'll need to understand how to handle and present those clues in a way that others—lawyers, auditors, regulators, managers, or even a jury—can trust, understand, and act upon.

:bulb: Imagine this: You discover a malware infection in your company's production environment. You isolate the machine, preserve the drive, and even gather logs from the affected servers. But two months later, when the breach goes to court or is reviewed by your internal security committee, you realize your notes on the time and method of collection are missing. Or worse, you discover that your evidence lacks clear hashes proving its integrity. At that moment, all the technical brilliance you applied becomes legally and practically useless. Evidence reporting and documentation aren't administrative chores; they're the tools that convert digital artifacts into credible, usable proof. Done right, your documentation and reporting will allow your evidence to "speak for itself," even when you're not in the room.

Before diving into reporting formats or templates, let’s focus on the qualities every piece of evidence must have. These principles are your measuring stick, both in court and in the field:
- **Accuracy.** If evidence does not reflect the reality of what happened, it's meaningless. Accuracy starts with correct data collection (such as using proper tools like write blockers for forensic images) and continues through detailed, honest documentation.
- **Authenticity.** Can you prove this piece of evidence hasn't been altered? Authenticity relies on things like cryptographic hashes, tamper-evident seals, access controls, and chain-of-custody logs. If someone challenges the evidence in court, you should be able to show where it's been and who had access to it, minute by minute.
- **Comprehensibility.** Evidence that's impossible to understand is as good as no evidence at all. Your reports should make the context and relevance of the evidence clear, even to non-technical stakeholders. Screenshots, timelines, and short, plain-language descriptions are your allies.
- **Convincing.** Good evidence should leave little room for doubt. This isn't about manipulation; it's about thoroughness. When all the metadata aligns, the story flows logically, and the integrity checks pass, your evidence becomes hard to dispute.
- **Objective.** Your job is not to tell a story that "helps your side," but to present facts as they are. The credibility of the whole security team can be shattered if your documentation suggests bias, cherry-picking, or speculation.
- **Admissible.** This is the ultimate test: would a court allow it? To be admissible, evidence must meet legal criteria like relevance, materiality, and competence. Following strict handling procedures and documenting every step of collection increases the chance your evidence will hold up under scrutiny.

A well-documented investigation is a time machine. Even months or years later, a clear report lets anyone walk through your steps and understand what happened. Here’s how to approach it:
- Document in Real Time Memories fade and systems change. Write everything down as soon as you do it: the time you imaged a drive, the tool version you used, the exact commands or procedures you followed, and who was present.
- Be Methodical, Not Creative This is one area where creativity can hurt. Stick to known frameworks, templates, and checklists. Consistency reduces errors and enhances trust.
- Tell a Story, Not Just Facts Facts alone are dry and often confusing. Shape them into a narrative: what was discovered, when, what actions were taken, why those decisions were made, and what the outcomes were.
- Support with Metadata and Screenshots A human-readable timeline is great, but supporting it with evidence hashes, log file timestamps, screenshots, and diagrams makes your work irrefutable.

Incident reports act as a passport for your evidence to move through internal reviews, compliance audits, and legal scrutiny. A typical incident report includes:
- Summary of the incident
- Who discovered it and when
- Steps taken to secure and collect evidence
- Tools and methods used (including version numbers)
- Chain-of-custody record
- Integrity verification (hashes before and after collection)
- Conclusions, recommendations, and pending actions

A well-prepared report doesn't just defend your actions; it gives your organization the power to make informed decisions, patch vulnerabilities, and prepare for regulatory questions.

:necktie: Evidence is more than a file on a USB stick or a printout of logs. It is the silent witness to security incidents—and your job is to make sure its voice is heard, clearly and credibly. In cybersecurity, where so much happens invisibly and at machine speed, your ability to document and report effectively can mean the difference between a resolved case and a failed prosecution. Take pride in the process, not just the outcome.

## 7.1.3 Investigative techniques ##

In the world of cybersecurity, technical skill will get you far, but it won't get you all the way. At some point, you'll realize that catching the hacker, identifying the source of an insider leak, or tracing the path of data exfiltration isn't enough. You also need to prove it. And in the professional world — especially in regulated environments or when legal action looms — proving something means following a disciplined investigation process.

In any investigation, whether digital or physical, you can't just grab what you find and call it "evidence." Evidence must be obtained legally and ethically to be admissible, reliable, and useful. Understanding how evidence is gathered is just as important as knowing what to gather.
There are five key paths to legally acquiring evidence, each with specific scenarios and limitations:

1. **Voluntary Surrender.** Sometimes the simplest path is the most overlooked. If a user, employee, or third party willingly turns over data or hardware, that's voluntary surrender. This is the cleanest and least contested form of evidence acquisition, as consent is clear. Think of an employee handing over a USB stick for inspection after noticing suspicious files. The catch? Consent can be withdrawn unless a formal agreement or custody process is established.
2. **Subpoena.** A subpoena is a formal legal order that compels a person or organization to hand over documents, records, or evidence. In cybersecurity investigations, this might be used to request logs from an ISP, chat histories from a service provider, or archived emails. Subpoenas are powerful but require time and proper legal procedures. The advantage is clear: refusal can carry legal penalties, making this an essential tool in both criminal and civil cases.
3. **Plain View Doctrine.** If during a lawful activity, evidence is in plain sight, it can be legally seized and used. Imagine an IT administrator performing routine maintenance and stumbling upon an unencrypted folder labeled "Payroll_Leak" containing sensitive data being prepared for exfiltration. As long as the admin had authorized access to that system, the discovery is legitimate. The plain view doctrine prevents criminals from hiding behind the argument of search limitations when the evidence is visible and discoverable without special effort.
4. **Search Warrant.** When suspicion is strong but access is restricted, authorities may obtain a search warrant. This is a court order granting permission to search specific premises and seize specific evidence. In digital investigations, warrants might authorize the imaging of a server or the confiscation of physical storage devices. The warrant must be specific; overreach can result in the exclusion of improperly gathered evidence.
5. **Exigent Circumstances.** Sometimes the clock is ticking too fast for paperwork. Exigent circumstances allow for evidence collection without prior authorization if delay could result in data destruction, harm, or further criminal activity. For instance, if an attacker is actively wiping logs from a compromised machine, security staff might justify immediate evidence capture before the trail is lost.

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voluntary Surrender   | Evidence willingly turned over by a user, employee, or third party.                                                   | An employee hands over a USB stick after noticing suspicious files.                            | Cleanest and least contested form of evidence acquisition due to clear consent.         | Consent can be withdrawn unless a formal agreement or custody process is established. |
| Subpoena              | A formal legal order compelling a person or organization to provide documents or evidence.                            | Requesting logs from an ISP or archived emails from a service provider.                        | Refusal carries legal penalties, making it a powerful tool in criminal and civil cases. | Requires time and proper legal procedures to obtain.                                  |
| Plain View Doctrine   | Evidence discovered in plain sight during lawful activity can be legally seized.                                      | An IT admin performing routine maintenance finds an unencrypted folder labeled "Payroll_Leak." | Legally allows seizure of visible evidence without special effort.                      | Only applies if the observer had lawful access; evidence not hidden.                  |
| Search Warrant        | Court order granting permission to search specific premises and seize specific evidence.                              | Imaging a server or confiscating storage devices after suspicion of wrongdoing.                | Authorizes lawful seizure while ensuring evidence can be used in court.                 | Must be specific; overreach can result in exclusion of evidence.                      |
| Exigent Circumstances | Evidence can be collected immediately without prior authorization if delay risks destruction, harm, or further crime. | Active attack where logs are being wiped from a compromised machine.                           | Allows immediate capture of critical evidence before it is lost.                        | Must justify urgency; misuse can be challenged legally.                               |


Now that we understand the lawful avenues for gathering evidence, let’s talk about the practical fieldwork — the techniques you'll actually use to piece together the facts. Think of these as our four investigative pillars:

1. **Data Capture.** This is the bread and butter of digital forensics. Data capture includes imaging hard drives, copying log files, extracting volatile memory (RAM), and capturing network traffic. The goal is to create a faithful, unaltered snapshot of digital information. Using proper tools (write blockers, hash verification, forensic suites like EnCase or FTK) ensures that you preserve the original evidence and work only with validated copies. Why is this important? Because digital evidence is incredibly fragile. Powering off a machine can erase volatile data. Opening a file can change its access timestamps. Data capture, done early and correctly, locks in the state of the system before human error or malicious actors can muddy the waters.
2. **Interviews.** Interviews are a goldmine for context. They are typically non-confrontational conversations aimed at gathering facts, timelines, and observations. Think of talking to system administrators, end-users, or third-party vendors. The key here is building rapport and asking open-ended questions. You’re not just hunting for yes/no answers, but for clues the person might not even realize are important: “When did you first notice the unusual activity?” or “Can you describe what you were doing just before the system crashed?”
3. **Interrogations.** Unlike interviews, interrogations are adversarial. They are designed to challenge and verify known facts, especially when dealing with suspected perpetrators. This technique requires careful preparation, documentation, and usually the involvement of legal counsel. The tone is structured and designed to test inconsistencies. In cyber incidents, this could be used when an employee is suspected of data theft or intentional policy violations.
4. **External Requests.** Sometimes the evidence you need lives outside your organization’s walls. External requests involve reaching out to ISPs, cloud providers, social media platforms, or law enforcement partners to obtain relevant data. These requests must follow formal channels and often require subpoenas, NDAs, or collaboration agreements. Knowing the timelines and the correct points of contact is crucial, as delays can result in the loss of time-sensitive logs or communications.

:necktie: The heart of a cybersecurity investigation isn’t in fancy tools or titles; it’s in methodical thinking and ethical action. Evidence gathering and investigative techniques aren’t just about following a process — they’re about telling the truth in a way that can stand up to scrutiny, whether from management, regulators, or a courtroom.

## 7.1.5 Artifacts (e.g., data, computer, network, mobile device) ##

No attacker leaves a system untouched, no breach happens without a trace, and no exfiltration is ever entirely invisible. Whether you're tracking a skilled cybercriminal or investigating an insider gone rogue, evidence is always left behind. The real challenge? Knowing where and how to find it.

That’s where understanding investigation artifacts and applying Locard’s Exchange Principle can give you an edge.
A century ago, Dr. Edmond Locard — often called the "Sherlock Holmes of Lyon" — taught the world an essential forensic truth: "*Every contact leaves a trace.*"

In cybersecurity, this principle is no different. Every time a hacker interacts with a system, whether it’s through a phishing email, remote access, or malware deployment, they alter something. It could be a new file, an unexpected network connection, a timestamp shifted by microseconds, or a suspicious process running in memory.
Your job, as a security professional, is to spot these disturbances in the digital "fabric" and tie them back to the threat. Even if the attacker believes they covered their tracks, the absence of normal behavior can itself become evidence.

:necktie: Locard’s Principle is your mental model for assuming that every action in cyberspace leaves artifacts worth investigating.

Let’s unpack the main places where this evidence hides.

**Data** is the most direct and obvious evidence, but it’s also the most flexible and easily manipulated. Artifacts might include:
- Files and Documents: Modified, deleted, or renamed.
- Metadata: Who created a file, when it was last accessed, and by whom.
- Database entries: New or missing records.
- Configuration changes: Evidence of tampering with system settings or application configurations.

Here’s why this matters: in real incidents, attackers often leave behind data artifacts as a side effect of their main goal. If they steal files, delete logs, or alter configurations to maintain persistence, these traces become critical proof points.
Imagine walking into a crime scene in the physical world. You look for fingerprints, footprints, or scratches. In the digital world, your "crime scene" is the computer, and its internal state is your evidence.

Artifacts here might include:
- Event Logs: Windows Event Viewer, Linux syslogs.
- Process Lists: What was running at the time of compromise?
- Scheduled Tasks: Malicious persistence mechanisms.
- Registry Entries (Windows): Modifications or newly added keys.

:bulb: The computer’s operating system is like a witness with a perfect memory — but only if you capture its state before it’s altered or rebooted. That’s why proper imaging and volatile memory capture are so heavily emphasized in digital forensics.

If computers are the crime scene, networks are the getaway route. Every connection to or from a system leaves traces, even if the attacker uses encryption, proxies, or Tor.
Key network artifacts might include:
- Firewall Logs: Blocked or allowed traffic patterns.
- NetFlow Records: Source, destination, and data volume.
- Packet Captures (PCAP): Direct evidence of conversations, sometimes even reconstructed files.
- DNS Queries: A sneaky but common channel for exfiltration and command-and-control.

Why is this gold for an investigator? Because network traffic is often stored in central locations — independent of whether the endpoint is wiped or altered. Attackers might control the victim machine, but they usually can't erase evidence from upstream routers or cloud firewall logs.

In today’s workplace, **mobile devices** are often as important as desktops — sometimes even more so. Mobile devices offer investigators:
- Call and Message Logs: Evidence of communication.
- Geolocation Data: Where the device was at key times.
- Application Data: Especially from cloud-synced apps like WhatsApp, Google Drive, or Dropbox.
- Cache and Artifacts: Even deleted photos or chats can leave fingerprints.

In the world of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), this gets even more complicated — and interesting. Even if the breach happened on a company server, an insider might have copied sensitive files onto their phone. Locard's Principle would apply here, too: there’s always a trace, even across devices.
So why is all this important? Because in an investigation, you don’t get second chances. Once you start pulling data, if you do it incorrectly — if you miss the hidden artifacts, fail to preserve timestamps, or neglect proper chain-of-custody — your case can fall apart.

That’s why digital forensics isn’t just about running the right tools, but about cultivating the right mindset: one of careful observation, methodical work, and knowing which artifacts offer the most valuable clues.

When you think like an investigator, you start connecting dots the moment you step into an incident. The clues might be subtle — a changed file hash, a deleted log entry, or a foreign IP address — but they’re always there.

:necktie: Evidence isn't always where you expect, but it’s always somewhere.

### Open Questions ###

1. What does Locard’s Exchange Principle state, and why is it so important for cybersecurity investigations?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Locard’s Principle states that “every contact leaves a trace.” In cybersecurity, this means any interaction with a system — from login attempts to malware installation — alters something. Understanding this helps investigators stay alert to subtle changes in data, system state, or logs that attackers may leave behind. </details>

2. Why are network artifacts often considered more reliable than endpoint artifacts during a cybersecurity investigation?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Network artifacts are often more reliable because they are usually stored centrally, making them harder for attackers to alter. Attackers who compromise an endpoint typically don't have access to the organization's network infrastructure, so logs from firewalls, proxies, and network appliances are less likely to be manipulated. </details>

3. An IT investigator finds a suspicious process running on a server named updatecheck.exe. What category of artifacts does this belong to?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The suspicious process updatecheck.exe is a computer artifact. Specifically, it's related to active processes, which are key indicators of what was running on the system at the time of the incident. </details>

4. A security analyst discovers that an attacker exfiltrated data using DNS queries. What type of artifact did the attacker leave behind?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The attacker left behind network artifacts — specifically in the DNS logs or packet captures — which could show abnormal patterns consistent with data exfiltration via DNS tunneling. </details>

5. Why is capturing volatile memory (RAM) important during forensic investigations on a compromised computer?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> RAM contains real-time, volatile evidence such as active processes, network connections, and encryption keys, all of which are lost once the device is powered off. Capturing RAM ensures critical information is preserved for later analysis. </details>

6. What kinds of investigation artifacts can mobile devices provide during an inquiry?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Mobile devices can provide a variety of artifacts, including call logs, text messages, GPS data, cached files, application data, and records of deleted files — all of which can help reconstruct user behavior and potential data compromise. </details>

7. How does understanding Locard’s Principle change the way a cybersecurity professional approaches an incident response?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Understanding Locard’s Principle encourages cybersecurity professionals to assume that every attack leaves traces, no matter how small. This approach promotes careful and thorough examination of systems, logs, and metadata during investigations. </details>

8. Why must forensic investigators preserve both the original data and its metadata during evidence collection?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Metadata provides essential context, including timestamps, file paths, ownership, and access history. If metadata is not preserved accurately, the timeline and credibility of the evidence could be questioned, especially in legal proceedings. </details>

9. What type of artifact would an investigator most likely retrieve from a company firewall during an investigation?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An investigator would retrieve network artifacts, such as log entries showing traffic flow, source and destination IP addresses, port usage, connection timestamps, and sometimes rule-based event alerts. </details>

10. During an insider threat investigation, an employee claims they never transferred company files. The analyst finds a cloud sync app's cache on their mobile device with recent activity. Which principle and artifact type apply here?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Locard’s Principle applies because the act of transferring files leaves behind traces, even if the user denies it. The artifact type is mobile device artifacts, specifically cached data and sync logs from the cloud application. </details>
