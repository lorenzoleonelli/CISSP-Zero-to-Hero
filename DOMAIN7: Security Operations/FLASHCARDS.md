<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Ensuring that evidence remains unchanged from the time of collection to presentation. </details>

24. What is volatile data?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Data that is lost when power is removed, such as RAM contents or active network connections. </details>

25. What is the order of volatility?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A guideline for collecting evidence from most volatile (RAM) to least volatile (archives). </details>

26. What is the goal of monitoring in security operations?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> To detect suspicious activity or policy violations in real time or near-real time. </details>

27. What is the difference between proactive and reactive monitoring?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Proactive monitoring looks for early signs of problems, while reactive monitoring responds to known incidents. </details>
