3. A security company has intercepted encrypted messages exchanged between suspected attackers. Analysts have access only to the encrypted data and need to gather actionable insights. Considering the strong encryption in place, which approach would most effectively help analysts derive useful intelligence without attempting to decrypt the messages?

A. OSINT Analysis

B. Check the sender IP against IP blocklists

C. Brute force decryption

D. Metadata Analysis

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Metadata Analysis

Explanation:
When intercepted messages are strongly encrypted, analysts cannot access the content directly. Metadata analysis focuses on “data about the data,” such as sender and recipient addresses, timestamps, communication frequency, and file sizes. By analyzing patterns and relationships within metadata, analysts can infer communication behaviors, identify potential adversary networks, and gather actionable intelligence without decrypting the messages. This approach is efficient and practical compared to attempting brute force decryption.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. OSINT Analysis:
OSINT gathers information from public sources like websites, social media, and news. While useful for context and background, it does not directly analyze intercepted encrypted communications or provide insights from metadata.

❌ B. Check the sender IP against IP blocklists:
Matching IPs against blocklists may reveal suspicious activity, but it provides limited insight into communication patterns and relationships. It is useful as a supplementary measure but not the primary method for intelligence gathering.

❌ C. Brute force decryption:

4. Your security consultant has flagged a vulnerability on your Linux server due to a TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) flaw, which allows unauthorized users to access files before proper permission checks are completed. What action should you take to mitigate this issue?

A. Implement file locks

B. Implement a password minimum age policy

C. Implement a policy that does not allow the use of Discretionary Access Control

D. Verify that usernames are unique

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. Implement file locks

Explanation:
File locks prevent multiple processes from accessing or modifying a file simultaneously. By implementing file locks, you ensure that files remain exclusively accessible during critical operations, eliminating the race condition that TOCTOU vulnerabilities exploit. This effectively closes the timing gap between the permission check and actual file use.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Implement a password minimum age policy:
Password age policies control how often passwords can be changed and do not affect file access timing. This measure does not mitigate TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

❌ C. Implement a policy that does not allow the use of Discretionary Access Control:
TOCTOU vulnerabilities arise from timing gaps, not from the presence of DAC. Removing DAC does not address the underlying race condition.

❌ D. Verify that usernames are unique:
Unique usernames help with accountability and identification, but they do not prevent unauthorized access during the critical timing window exploited by TOCTOU flaws.
