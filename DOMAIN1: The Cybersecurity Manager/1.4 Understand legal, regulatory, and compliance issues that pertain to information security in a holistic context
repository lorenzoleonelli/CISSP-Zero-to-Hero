## 1.4.1 Cybercrimes and data breaches ##

:necktie: As a security professional, you are anticipated to communicate effectively with C-level executives, operational personnel, and external stakeholders such as lawyers. However, it is equally important to recognize your limitations and know when to seek legal advice when necessary.

Every organization should be addressing essential inquiries such as:
- What measures are in place to safeguard our information and assets?
- What are the information security challenges specific to our organization within a global framework?
- What is the current state of the threat landscape?

This scrutiny is crucial due to the lucrative nature of cybercrime, which often leads organizations to refrain from acknowledging victimization or pursuing cybercriminals.
While it's impossible to thwart every attack, implementing effective security measures can deter cyber intrusions by rendering them:
- Unprofitable
- Labor-intensive
- Cost-prohibitive

In essence, organizations must not present themselves as easy targets for cyber threats.

:necktie: You may never achieve complete invulnerability for your company, but it's essential to find the appropriate compromise to ensure your company is adequately protected.

Criminals may target computers directly or exploit them to facilitate traditional criminal activities. Whether driven by profit or notoriety, malicious actors can leverage readily available tools, requiring minimal technical expertise to inflict significant damage on the digital landscape. Moreover, with nation-state actors continuously enhancing their capabilities to target information and infrastructure, today's information security professionals face an increasingly challenging task in safeguarding their environments from compromise.

The laws highlighted in the following table pertain to federal regulations in the United States. It's important to note that nearly every state in the country has implemented legislation addressing computer security matters. Due to the internet's worldwide influence, many computer-related crimes transcend state boundaries, thus falling within federal jurisdiction and undergoing prosecution in federal courts. Nonetheless, certain situations may see state laws imposing more stringent regulations and penalties compared to federal laws.
