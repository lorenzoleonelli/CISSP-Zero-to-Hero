## 1.4.1 Cybercrimes and data breaches ##

:necktie: As a security professional, you are anticipated to communicate effectively with C-level executives, operational personnel, and external stakeholders such as lawyers. However, it is equally important to recognize your limitations and know when to seek legal advice when necessary.

Every organization should be addressing essential inquiries such as:
- What measures are in place to safeguard our information and assets?
- What are the information security challenges specific to our organization within a global framework?
- What is the current state of the threat landscape?

This scrutiny is crucial due to the lucrative nature of cybercrime, which often leads organizations to refrain from acknowledging victimization or pursuing cybercriminals.
While it's impossible to thwart every attack, implementing effective security measures can deter cyber intrusions by rendering them:
- Unprofitable
- Labor-intensive
- Cost-prohibitive

In essence, organizations must not present themselves as easy targets for cyber threats.

:necktie: You may never achieve complete invulnerability for your company, but it's essential to find the appropriate compromise to ensure your company is adequately protected.

Criminals may target computers directly or exploit them to facilitate traditional criminal activities. Whether driven by profit or notoriety, malicious actors can leverage readily available tools, requiring minimal technical expertise to inflict significant damage on the digital landscape. Moreover, with nation-state actors continuously enhancing their capabilities to target information and infrastructure, today's information security professionals face an increasingly challenging task in safeguarding their environments from compromise.

The laws highlighted in the following table pertain to federal regulations in the United States. It's important to note that nearly every state in the country has implemented legislation addressing computer security matters. Due to the internet's worldwide influence, many computer-related crimes transcend state boundaries, thus falling within federal jurisdiction and undergoing prosecution in federal courts. Nonetheless, certain situations may see state laws imposing more stringent regulations and penalties compared to federal laws.

| **Federal Law** | **Year** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------|------------------|
| **Computer Crime and Abuse Act (CCCA)** | 1984 | Outlined prohibited actions including:<br>- Unauthorized access to classified or financial federal systems<br>- Accessing federally used computers without authorization<br>- Perpetrating fraud using federal computers<br>- Causing over $1,000 damage to federal systems<br>- Altering medical records impacting care<br>- Trafficking computer passwords tied to interstate commerce or federal systems |
| **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** | 1986 | Extended the CCCA by increasing the damage threshold to $5,000 and expanding scope to all "federal interest" computers, including:<br>- Any computer used by the U.S. government or financial institutions<br>- Offenses obstructing those systems<br>- Cases involving multiple computers, even across state lines |
| **CFAA Amendments** *(Computer Abuse Amendments Act)* | 1994 | Added provisions to:<br>- Prohibit malicious code creation<br>- Expand jurisdiction to interstate commerce systems<br>- Allow imprisonment regardless of intent<br>- Enable civil remedies for victims (injunctions, compensation) |
| **National Information Infrastructure Protection Act** | 1996 | Expanded the CFAA to:<br>- Cover international commerce systems<br>- Protect critical infrastructure (railroads, pipelines, grids, telecom)<br>- Classify intentional/reckless damage to national infrastructure as felonies |
| **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)** | 2002 | Mandated NIST to define security standards. Key components:<br>- Periodic risk assessments<br>- Security policy development<br>- Security training and testing<br>- Incident response processes<br>- Continuity planning for information systems |
| **Federal Cybersecurity Laws** *(FISMA Modernization, Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, National Cybersecurity Protection Act)* | 2014 | Modernized federal cybersecurity with:<br>- DHS taking primary responsibility (except DoD and intelligence)<br>- NIST tasked with voluntary cybersecurity standards (SP 800 series)<br>- Creation of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (DHS) for coordination of cybersecurity risks and incidents |

### Open Questions ###
1. How can organizations make themselves less attractive targets for cybercriminals, even if complete invulnerability is unattainable?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Organizations can deter cyber intrusions by implementing security measures that make attacks unprofitable, labor-intensive, and cost-prohibitive. This involves layering security controls, establishing robust incident response plans, and fostering a culture of security awareness.
</details>

2. Why is understanding federal jurisdiction important in the context of computer-related crimes?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Understanding federal jurisdiction is crucial because many computer-related crimes cross state lines due to the internet's global reach. Federal laws like the CFAA provide a framework for prosecuting these offenses in federal courts, ensuring consistent enforcement and addressing the complexities of cybercrime.
</details>

3. Explain the key expansions introduced by the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 expanded the CFAA's scope to include computer systems used in international commerce, extended protections to critical infrastructure beyond computing systems, and classified intentional or reckless damage to such infrastructure as felonies.
</details>

4. What are the primary responsibilities outlined for NIST under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Under FISMA, NIST is responsible for developing guidelines for implementing information security programs, including conducting risk assessments, establishing policies and procedures, providing security awareness training, and ensuring the continuity of operations for organizational information systems.
</details>

5. What were the primary objectives of the cybersecurity legislation signed by President Barack Obama in 2014?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
The 2014 cybersecurity legislation aimed to modernize federal cybersecurity efforts by centralizing responsibility under the Department of Homeland Security, tasking NIST with coordinating voluntary cybersecurity standards, and establishing a national center for cybersecurity collaboration between government agencies and civilian organizations.
</details>

6. How does the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986 differ from the Computer Crime and Abuse Act (CCCA) of 1984?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
The CFAA of 1986 expanded upon the CCCA of 1984 by increasing the damage threshold from $1,000 to $5,000 and broadening the scope from federal computers processing sensitive data to all "federal interest" computers, including those used by financial institutions and systems involved in interstate commerce.
