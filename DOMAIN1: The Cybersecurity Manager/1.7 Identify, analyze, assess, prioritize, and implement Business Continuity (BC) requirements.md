Business Continuity Planning (BCP) involves assessing the risk to organizational processes and creating policies, plans, and procedures to minimize the impact those risks might have on the organization if they were to occur.
BCP is used to maintain the continuous operation of a business in the event of an emergency, with a goal to implement a combination of policies, procedures, and processes. Business Continuity requires a lot of planning and preparation. Actual implementation of business continuity processes occur quite infrequently. The primary facets of business continuity are:
- **Resilience**: (e.g. within a data center and between sites or data centers),
- **Recovery**: if a service becomes unavailable, you need to recover it as soon as possible, and
- **Contingency**: a last resort in case resilience and recovery prove ineffective

BCP vs DR:
- BCP activities are typically strategically focused at a high level and center themselves on business processes and operations
- DR plans tend to be more tactical and describe technical activities such as recovery sites, backups, and fault tolerance. A DR plan is carried out when everything is still in emergency (while a BCP takes a broader approach to the problem)
- BCM (Business Continuity Management) is the management process that covers both BCP and DR

:necktie: BCP is wider in scope and more strategic than DR.
