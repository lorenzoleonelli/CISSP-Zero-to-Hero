## 1.7 Identify, analyze, assess, prioritize, and implement Business Continuity (BC) requirements ##

Business Continuity Planning (BCP) involves assessing the risk to organizational processes and creating policies, plans, and procedures to minimize the impact those risks might have on the organization if they were to occur.
BCP is used to maintain the continuous operation of a business in the event of an emergency, with a goal to implement a combination of policies, procedures, and processes. Business Continuity requires a lot of planning and preparation. Actual implementation of business continuity processes occur quite infrequently. The primary facets of business continuity are:
- **Resilience**: (e.g. within a data center and between sites or data centers),
- **Recovery**: if a service becomes unavailable, you need to recover it as soon as possible, and
- **Contingency**: a last resort in case resilience and recovery prove ineffective

BCP vs DR:
- BCP activities are typically strategically focused at a high level and center themselves on business processes and operations
- DR plans tend to be more tactical and describe technical activities such as recovery sites, backups, and fault tolerance. A DR plan is carried out when everything is still in emergency (while a BCP takes a broader approach to the problem)
- BCM (Business Continuity Management) is the management process that covers both BCP and DR

:necktie: BCP is wider in scope and more strategic than DR.

The Business Continuity Planning process has four main steps:
1. Project scope and planning: Developing the project scope and plan starts with gaining support of the management team, making a business case (cost/benefit analysis, regulatory or compliance reasons,etc.) and gaining approval to move forward. Next, you need to form a team with representatives from the business as well as IT. Then you are ready to begin developing the plan.
2. Business impact analysis (BIA):Identify the systems and services that the business relies on and assess the impacts that a disruption or outage would cause, including the impacts on business processes like accounts receivable and sales. You also need to figure out which systems and services you need to get things running again (think foundational IT services such as the network and directory, which many other systems rely on). Finally, prioritize the order in which critical systems and services are recovered or brought back online. As part of the BIA, establish:
- recovery time objectives (RTO) (how long it takes to recover),
- recovery point objectives (RPO) (the maximum tolerable data loss), and
- maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), along with the costs of downtime and recovery
3. Continuity planning: The first two phases of the BCP process (project scope and planning and the business impact analysis) focus on determining how the BCP process will work and prioritizing the business assets that need to be protected against interruption. The next phase of BCP development, continuity planning, focuses on the development and implementation of a continuity strategy to minimize the impact realized risks might have on protected assets
There are two primary subtasks involved in continuity planning:
- Strategy development
- Provisions and processes
The goal of this process is to create a continuity of operations plan (COOP), which focuses on how an org will carry out critical business functions starting shortly after a disruption occurs and extending up to one month of sustained operations
4. Approval and implementation:
- BCP plan now needs sr. management buy-in (should be endorsed by the org's top exec)
- BCP team should create an implementation schedule, and all personnel involved should receive training on the plan.

:bulb: The top priority of BCP and DR are people. Always prioritize people's safety. Get people out of harm's way, and only after keep addressing IT recovery and restoration issues.

## 1.7.1 Business impact analysis (BIA) ##

According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a BIA is: *The process of analyzing the impact over time of a disruption on the organization.*
Essentially, a BIA helps an organization identify its critical business functions (CBFs) and understand the potential impact of a disaster or disruption on these functions. This analysis serves as the foundation for the business continuity plan (BCP).

The BIA process relies on several key metrics to quantify the potential impact of disruptions:
**MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)**: This is the maximum duration a business process can be unavailable before causing severe damage to the company.
*Think of it as the time limit for getting everything back to normal before serious problems arise. A bank’s online services might have an MTD of 4 hours. If customers can’t access their accounts for more than 4 hours, the bank could face significant reputational damage or regulatory penalties.*
**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: RPO defines the acceptable amount of data loss in case of a disaster. It specifies the point in time to which data must be restored.
*For example if the RPO for the bank's customer transactions is 15 minutes, the backup systems need to save data at least every 15 minutes to avoid losing important transactions during an outage.*
**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: RTO is the target time for restoring a system, application, or process after a disruption.
*If the bank’s mobile app has an RTO of 1 hour, the IT team needs to ensure the app is functional again within an hour of going offline.*
**WRT (Work Recovery Time)**: WRT refers to the time needed for testing and verifying restored systems before they go live.
*After restoring the bank’s online services in 1 hour (RTO), the team might need 30 additional minutes to test that login systems, transaction features, and notifications are working correctly. This 30 minutes is the WRT.*

The following steps are of fundamental importance in conducting a successful BIA:
- Executive Support: Securing buy-in from senior leadership is crucial, as BCP initiatives may not yield immediate tangible returns but are vital for long-term resilience.
- Project Team, Scope, and Budget: Defining the project team, scope, and budget ensures a focused and efficient BIA process.
- Identifying CBFs (Critical Business Factors): This is a critical step involving input from various stakeholders like system owners, subject-matter experts, customers, and suppliers.
- Impact Assessment: Analyzing the impact of disruptions on each CBF, considering the aforementioned metrics (MTD, RPO, RTO, WRT).


The following elements have to be considered when identifying CBFs:
- Personnel: Key personnel and their roles in maintaining critical operations.
- Business Processes: Essential business processes that drive revenue or ensure operational continuity.
- Information Systems and Applications: Critical IT systems and applications supporting core business functions.
- Other Assets: Physical assets, intellectual property, or other resources vital for business operations.

</details>

2. What is the difference between RTO and WRT?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
RTO focuses on the time to restore a system's basic functionality, while WRT accounts for the additional time required to thoroughly test and verify its complete functionality before making it live.
</details>

3. Why is defining the MTD crucial in business continuity planning?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
MTD defines the maximum allowable downtime before a business function faces severe consequences. Understanding this limit drives the urgency and prioritization of recovery efforts.
</details>

4. How does RPO influence a company's backup strategy?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
The RPO dictates the frequency of backups required to ensure the acceptable level of data loss. For a shorter RPO, more frequent backups are needed.
