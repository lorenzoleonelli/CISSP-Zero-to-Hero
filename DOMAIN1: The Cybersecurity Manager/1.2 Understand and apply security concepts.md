## Confidentiality, integrity, and availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation (5 Pillars of Information Security)

The five pillars of information security are the principles that guide the design, implementation, and management of secure systems. Each one of the 5 pillars addresses an aspect of information security, ensuring that data and systems remain protected from various threats. Here's an explanation of each:
1. **Confidentiality** ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. This means protecting data from unauthorized disclosure or access, whether intentional or accidental. Techniques such as encryption, access controls, and user authentication help maintain confidentiality by ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
2. **Integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy, reliability and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. It involves protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion, or tampering. Integrity safeguards data from both intentional and unintentional undesired modifications. Ensuring data integrity involves implementing controls such as data validation, checksums, and digital signatures to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to data.
3. **Availability** ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. This third pillar focuses on ensuring timely access to data and services. Measures such as redundancy, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery planning help maintain availability by ensuring continuous access to systems and resources.
4. **Authenticity** verifies the identity of users and ensures that data or communications originate from a trusted source. It involves confirming the legitimacy of individuals, devices, or processes involved in accessing or transmitting information. Authentication mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, and digital certificates help in establishing the authenticity of users and entities.
5. **Nonrepudiation** ensures that individuals cannot deny their actions or transactions. It provides evidence to prove that a specific action occurred and that the parties involved cannot refute their involvement. Nonrepudiation mechanisms such as digital signatures, audit trails, and transaction logs help establish accountability and provide a means to trace actions back to their originators. By ensuring nonrepudiation individuals are accountable for their actions in digital transactions.
