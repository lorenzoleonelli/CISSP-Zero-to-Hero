## 1.1.1 ISC2 Code of Professional Ethics

Ethics refer to a set of moral principles that guide individuals or groups in determining what is right or wrong, good or bad, in a given situation. They often encompass values such as honesty, fairness, integrity, and respect for others. Many professional bodies like ISC2 have established codes of ethics that members must adhere to, ensuring ethical conduct in their respective fields.

<B> All CISSP candidates must understand and integrate these ethics into their professional practice both before and after taking the exam, as they serve as guiding principles.

<L> The information in the following comes from: https://www.isc2.org/ethics.

All information security professionals who are certified by ISC2 recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, all ISC2 members are required to commit to fully support this Code of Ethics (the "Code"). ISC2 members who intentionally or knowingly violate any provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification. ISC2 members are obligated to follow the ethics complaint procedure upon observing any action by an ISC2 member that breaches the Code. Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Code pursuant to Canon IV.
There are only four mandatory canons in the Code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional.

Code of Ethics Preamble:
The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and duty to each other, require that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
