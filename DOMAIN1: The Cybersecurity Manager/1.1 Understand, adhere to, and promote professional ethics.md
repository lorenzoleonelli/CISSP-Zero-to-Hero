## 1.1.1 ISC2 Code of Professional Ethics

Ethics refer to a set of moral principles that guide individuals or groups in determining what is right or wrong, good or bad, in a given situation. They often encompass values such as honesty, fairness, integrity, and respect for others. Many professional bodies like ISC2 have established codes of ethics that members must adhere to, ensuring ethical conduct in their respective fields.

:brain: All CISSP candidates must understand and integrate these ethics into their professional practice both before and after taking the exam, as they serve as guiding principles. 

:link: The information in the following comes from: https://www.isc2.org/ethics.

>All information security professionals who are certified by ISC2 recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, all ISC2 members are required to commit to fully support this Code of Ethics (the "Code"). ISC2 members who intentionally or knowingly violate any provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification. ISC2 members are obligated to follow the ethics complaint procedure upon observing any action by an ISC2 member that breaches the Code. Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Code pursuant to Canon IV.
There are only four mandatory canons in the Code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional.

> Code of Ethics Preamble:
> - The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and duty to each other, require that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
> - Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.
>
> Code of Ethics Canons:
> 1. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.
> 2. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
> 3. Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
> 4. Advance and protect the profession.


:necktie: In his daily professional conduct, a genuine manager adheres to ethics canons, principles, and policies in descending order of importance. He frequently drafts ethical codes, principles, and policies to enable company personnel to seamlessly integrate them into their regular business practices.

:bulb: A code of ethics is usually designed to provide general direction rather than address specific technical situations.

:brain: Technical skills build systems. Ethics keep them worthy of trust.

(ISC)² has a formal, serious process for handling complaints, ensuring that the integrity of the certification and the trust in the profession are maintained.
The process is designed to be fair, thorough, and confidential. Here’s the key flow:
1. Filing a Complaint:
- Anyone can file a complaint including members of the public, employers, colleagues, or other (ISC)² members.
- The complaint must be in writing and specific.
- Anonymous complaints are generally not accepted.
2. Initial Review:
- The (ISC)² Ethics Committee reviews whether the complaint falls under its jurisdiction and whether it contains enough information to proceed.
- If the complaint is clearly frivolous or outside of ethics matters, it can be dismissed at this early stage.
3. Notification:
- If the complaint proceeds, the accused (called the respondent) is notified and given a chance to respond.
- This preserves due process — the right to defend oneself.
4. Investigation and Hearing:
- The Ethics Committee may investigate further if needed, gathering evidence.
- In complex cases, a formal hearing may be convened.
5. Decision and Sanctions:
- If the member is found to have violated the Code, the Committee decides on sanctions.
- Sanctions can include:
-- Private reprimand
-- Public reprimand
-- Suspension of certification
-- Revocation of certification
6. Appeal:
- The member has a right to appeal the decision within a specified timeframe.
- Appeals are typically reviewed by a separate (ISC)² committee.
