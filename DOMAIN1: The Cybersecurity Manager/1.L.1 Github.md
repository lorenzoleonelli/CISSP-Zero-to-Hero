GitHub isn't just a tool for software developers—it's a powerful platform for organizing, preserving, and versioning any kind of text-based content, especially Markdown. Thanks to its built-in version control system, it ensures the integrity of your data by keeping a complete history of every change. In the following section, we'll explore the basics of GitHub through a practical example, showing how you can use it as a personal learning platform to manage and track your technical knowledge over time.

## Prerequisites (5' required ... not more) ##
- A GitHub account https://github.com/
- Basic understanding of Markdown (recommended) https://www.markdownguide.org/
- (Optional) Git installed locally if you want to work offline

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository ##
1. Go to https://github.com

2. Click the + icon in the top right → New repository

3. Fill in:

- Repository name: e.g., my-knowledge-base

- Description (optional): "A version-controlled knowledge management system"

- Visibility: Choose Private if it's for personal use only

- Check Initialize this repository with a README

4. Click Create repository

## Step 2: Organize Your Knowledge with Folders and Markdown Files ##
1. On the repository page, click Add file → Create new file

2. To create a folder, use / in the filename:

- e.g., type: networking/tcp-ip.md

3. Inside the Markdown file, add your knowledge:
<pre>
```md  
# TCP/IP Basics
TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols...
```
</pre>
