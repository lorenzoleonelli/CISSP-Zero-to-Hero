## 1.4.1 Cybercrimes and data breaches ##

:necktie: As a security professional, you are anticipated to communicate effectively with C-level executives, operational personnel, and external stakeholders such as lawyers. However, it is equally important to recognize your limitations and know when to seek legal advice when necessary.

Every organization should be addressing essential inquiries such as:
- What measures are in place to safeguard our information and assets?
- What are the information security challenges specific to our organization within a global framework?
- What is the current state of the threat landscape?

This scrutiny is crucial due to the lucrative nature of cybercrime, which often leads organizations to refrain from acknowledging victimization or pursuing cybercriminals.
While it's impossible to thwart every attack, implementing effective security measures can deter cyber intrusions by rendering them:
- Unprofitable
- Labor-intensive
- Cost-prohibitive

In essence, organizations must not present themselves as easy targets for cyber threats.

:necktie: You may never achieve complete invulnerability for your company, but it's essential to find the appropriate compromise to ensure your company is adequately protected.

Criminals may target computers directly or exploit them to facilitate traditional criminal activities. Whether driven by profit or notoriety, malicious actors can leverage readily available tools, requiring minimal technical expertise to inflict significant damage on the digital landscape. Moreover, with nation-state actors continuously enhancing their capabilities to target information and infrastructure, today's information security professionals face an increasingly challenging task in safeguarding their environments from compromise.

The laws highlighted in the following table pertain to federal regulations in the United States. It's important to note that nearly every state in the country has implemented legislation addressing computer security matters. Due to the internet's worldwide influence, many computer-related crimes transcend state boundaries, thus falling within federal jurisdiction and undergoing prosecution in federal courts. Nonetheless, certain situations may see state laws imposing more stringent regulations and penalties compared to federal laws.

Security professionals should possess knowledge of the legal aspects concerning software licensing agreements. There are four prevalent types of license agreements in use today:
- Contractual license agreements involve a written contract delineating responsibilities between the software vendor and customer, commonly utilized for expensive or specialized software packages.
- Shrink-wrap license agreements are displayed on the exterior of software packaging and typically include a clause implying agreement upon breaking the shrink-wrap seal.
- Click-through (or browser wrap) license agreements, increasingly common, present contract terms either on the software box or within documentation, requiring users to actively acknowledge agreement during installation.
- Cloud services license agreements extend click-through agreements, often omitting written agreements and displaying legal terms on-screen for users to review, typically leading to users quickly clicking through without thorough examination.

| **License Type**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       | **Common Use**                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Contractual License**  | A written contract outlining responsibilities between vendor and customer.                                                                                            | Expensive or specialized software packages       |
| **Shrink-Wrap License**  | Terms printed on the software packaging; agreement is implied by breaking the shrink-wrap seal.                                                                       | Packaged, boxed software                         |
| **Click-Through License**<br>(a.k.a. Browser Wrap) | Terms are shown on-screen or in documentation; user must click “I agree” during installation.                                                                    | Widely used in downloadable/installable software |
| **Cloud Services License** | Extends click-through model; terms are shown on-screen during use or setup, often without a separate written contract. Users often skip reading.                     | SaaS and cloud-based services                    |

:brain: Remember the 4 types of license agreement: Contract, Shrink-wrap, click-through, cloud services.

:bulb: In a written contract, the customer typically has the opportunity to actively participate in the creation of the contract by negotiating its terms and signing the final document. However, in shrink-wrap and click-through agreements, the customer's role is limited to accepting the terms of the contract as presented by the seller or service provider. These agreements are often presented in a pre-packaged format, such as when purchasing software online (shrink-wrap) or agreeing to terms and conditions before accessing a website or app (click-through). In these cases, the customer's only option is to either accept the contract as is or decline the offer.

## 1.4.3 Import/export controls ##

The identical computers and encryption technologies utilized in powering the internet and facilitating e-commerce possess significant potential as formidable tools when wielded by a military force. Country-based rules and laws concerning import and export controls are established to regulate the movement of products, technologies, and information across borders, typically aimed at safeguarding national security, individual privacy, and economic interests.

The Wassenaar Arrangement aims to enhance "international security and stability" by overseeing the transfer of conventional weapons like firearms, explosives, naval weaponry, and landmines, as well as dual-use items and technologies. In 2013, the agreement underwent revisions to encompass cyber weapons, which include malicious software, command-and-control systems, and Internet surveillance tools.
The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is a US regulation designed to oversee the export of items listed in the United States Munitions List (USML), including missiles, rockets, and bombs, to maintain control over their dissemination.
The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) primarily addresses items intended for commercial use, such as computers and marine equipment, but also covers products with potential military applications, even if initially designed for commercial purposes.
