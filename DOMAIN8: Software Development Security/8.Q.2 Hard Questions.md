B. Hiring experienced and qualified developers

C. Conducting misuse case testing

D. Gathering and defining detailed requirements

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Gathering and defining detailed requirements

Explanation:
Security must be integrated from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle. By gathering and defining detailed requirements early on, the team can identify necessary security controls, assess potential risks, and align security goals with business needs. This proactive approach helps avoid costly fixes and vulnerabilities later in development.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ Hiring experienced and qualified developers: Important but insufficient without clear, security-focused requirements guiding development.

❌ Conducting misuse case testing: Useful later for identifying vulnerabilities, but it cannot replace the foundational security planning done during requirements gathering.

❌ Writing comprehensive test cases: Test cases verify functionality but won’t catch security issues unless those concerns are included in the initial requirements.

C. CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)

D. STRIDE

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)

Explanation:
CPE provides a standardized, consistent naming scheme for software platforms, including operating systems. It allows organizations to uniquely identify, classify, and reference operating systems and software products across security tools and frameworks. This standardized approach aids in vulnerability management and risk assessment.

Incorrect Answers:
❌ CVE: Focuses on identifying known vulnerabilities, not naming platforms.
❌ CVSS: Provides a scoring system for vulnerability severity, not a naming convention.
❌ STRIDE: A threat modeling framework, unrelated to naming or classification of OS.

7. You are working on a project where you need to choose a programming language that is interpreted, allowing for flexibility and quicker debugging. Which of the following languages is interpreted rather than compiled? (Choose all that apply)

A. Java

B. JavaScript

C. C++

D. Python

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answers:
✅ B. JavaScript
✅ D. Python

Explanation:
Python is an interpreted language, where code is executed line-by-line by the interpreter at runtime, enabling flexibility and faster debugging, though sometimes at the cost of slower performance compared to compiled languages.
JavaScript is also an interpreted language, typically run in browsers or environments like Node.js, allowing dynamic execution and flexibility for web applications.

Incorrect Answers:
❌ C++ is a compiled language, requiring code compilation to machine code before execution, offering faster runtime performance.
❌ Java is a hybrid language: it is compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While it involves interpretation, Java is not fully interpreted in the traditional sense.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answers:
✅ A. The portability between different operating systems increases.
✅ B. Instructions better approximate human communications.
✅ D. The time needed to craft an application decreases.

Explanation:

Instructions better approximate human communications: High-level languages use syntax closer to natural language, making code easier to read, write, and maintain compared to low-level Assembly language with cryptic commands.

The time needed to craft an application decreases: High-level languages provide abstractions, standard libraries, and frameworks that reduce coding effort and speed up development. For example, writing a simple program like "Hello, World!" takes one line in Python but many steps in Assembly.

The portability between different operating systems increases: High-level languages abstract hardware details, allowing the same code to run on different platforms with minimal or no modification (e.g., Java’s JVM, Python interpreters across OSes).

Incorrect Answer:
❌ C. Security is more embedded in the code: While some high-level languages offer features like automatic memory management that help avoid certain vulnerabilities, security depends mainly on developer practices and external controls. High-level languages do not inherently guarantee secure code.
