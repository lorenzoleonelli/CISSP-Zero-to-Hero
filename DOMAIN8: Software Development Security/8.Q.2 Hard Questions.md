## Hard Questions ##

1. Your company has just purchased a new software solution to manage sensitive customer data. As the cybersecurity lead, you are responsible for securing the software during installation. Which of the following are standard security hardening steps you should follow when installing the new software? (Choose all that apply)

A. Conducting a legal compliance check

B. Implementing secure logging and monitoring

C. Performing basic configuration

D. Ensuring documentation and training

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answers:

✅ B. Implementing secure logging and monitoring
✅ C. Performing basic configuration

Explanation:

Implementing secure logging and monitoring: Ensures all activities (access, errors) are recorded for audits and threat detection. Continuous monitoring helps detect suspicious behaviors early.

Performing basic configuration: Includes changing default credentials, limiting permissions, and adjusting settings to minimize attack surfaces and enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.

Incorrect Answers:
❌ Conducting a legal compliance check: Important for governance but not a technical hardening step during installation.
❌ Ensuring documentation and training: Valuable for usability and operational success but does not directly secure the software during installation.

2. Your company has just deployed a new web application to enhance customer engagement. As part of securing the application post-installation, you need to decide the first critical step to minimize potential security risks. What should you do first?

A. Search for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to the application

B. Perform a vulnerability scan of the web application

C. Add the application to the IT Service Management (ITSM) system

D. Change the default credentials of the application

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Change the default credentials of the application

Explanation:
Changing default credentials is the first and most critical step after installing a web application. Default usernames and passwords are widely known and easily exploited by attackers. Securing these credentials immediately prevents unauthorized access.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ Perform a vulnerability scan of the web application: Important but should come after basic security configurations like changing default credentials. Scanning too early can reveal obvious vulnerabilities that are easily mitigated.

❌ Add the application to the IT Service Management (ITSM) system: An administrative task for tracking and monitoring, but it doesn’t directly reduce immediate security risks.

❌ Search for known CVEs related to the application: Valuable for patching and risk management but typically done after initial hardening steps like securing credentials.

3. Your company has identified multiple buffer overflow issues in its internally developed software, which could lead to significant vulnerabilities. As the security lead, what is the first countermeasure you should implement to address these issues effectively?

A. Apply proper software validation and testing techniques

B. Implement robust input validation in the software

C. Ensure the operating system is updated with the latest security patches

D. Conduct training sessions for programmers on secure coding practices

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Conduct training sessions for programmers on secure coding practices

Explanation:
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities often result from poor coding practices like inadequate input validation and improper memory handling. While technical fixes like input validation are important, training developers on secure coding is the foundational step to prevent these issues from occurring in the first place.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ Implement robust input validation in the software: This is an effective technical fix for existing code but does not prevent new vulnerabilities if developers are not trained.

❌ Ensure the operating system is updated with the latest security patches: While important for overall security, OS patching does not directly address application-level buffer overflows.

❌ Apply proper software validation and testing techniques: These are reactive steps to find vulnerabilities but don’t prevent insecure coding practices that cause them.

4. Your organization is embarking on developing a new software application that will handle sensitive customer data. To ensure that security vulnerabilities are minimized throughout the development process, which of the following activities should you prioritize to prevent security issues?

A. Writing comprehensive test cases

B. Hiring experienced and qualified developers

C. Conducting misuse case testing

D. Gathering and defining detailed requirements

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Gathering and defining detailed requirements

Explanation:
Security must be integrated from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle. By gathering and defining detailed requirements early on, the team can identify necessary security controls, assess potential risks, and align security goals with business needs. This proactive approach helps avoid costly fixes and vulnerabilities later in development.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ Hiring experienced and qualified developers: Important but insufficient without clear, security-focused requirements guiding development.

❌ Conducting misuse case testing: Useful later for identifying vulnerabilities, but it cannot replace the foundational security planning done during requirements gathering.

❌ Writing comprehensive test cases: Test cases verify functionality but won’t catch security issues unless those concerns are included in the initial requirements.
