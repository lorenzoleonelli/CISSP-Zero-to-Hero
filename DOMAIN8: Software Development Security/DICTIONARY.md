**Agile:** A software development methodology characterized by iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative effort.

**Application Programming Interface (API):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software components or applications to communicate with each other.

**Application Security:** The process of ensuring that applications are secure from external threats throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

**Attestation:** A formal declaration or confirmation that the software meets specific security standards or criteria.

**Authorization:** The function of specifying access rights to resources, typically based on a user's identity and privileges.

**Black Box Testing:** Security testing methodology where the tester has no internal knowledge of the system's structure, code, or design.

**Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** The creation of a plan to ensure that essential business functions can continue during and after a disaster or disruption.

**Change Management:** A structured approach for managing changes to the software, configuration, or environment to minimize disruption and maintain system integrity.

**Configuration Management:** The process of managing and tracking all changes to the configuration details of a system, application, or network infrastructure.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** A set of practices that automates the integration, testing, and delivery of software changes, often relying heavily on DevSecOps principles.

**Cryptographic Controls:** The use of encryption, hashing, and digital signatures to protect data confidentiality and integrity within an application.

**Data Classification:** The process of categorizing data based on its sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements to determine appropriate security controls.

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Tools and policies designed to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's network or systems.

**Defense in Depth:** The strategy of employing multiple layers of security controls to protect a system or network, so if one fails, others remain.

**Deprovisioning:** The process of removing or revoking access rights and privileges when they are no longer needed (e.g., when an employee leaves).

**Design Review:** A formal checkpoint in the SDLC where the proposed architecture and design of a system are scrutinized to identify potential flaws and security weaknesses.

**DevSecOps:** The philosophy of integrating security practices and tools into the DevOps pipeline, making security a shared responsibility throughout the SDLC.

**Fault Tolerance:** The ability of a system to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail.

**Fuzz Testing:** A technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to a system's inputs to discover errors and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Hardening:** The process of configuring a system or application to reduce its attack surface by turning off unnecessary services, accounts, and features.

**Input Validation:** The security practice of properly testing and sanitizing all user-supplied data before it is processed by an application to prevent injection attacks.

**Least Privilege (PoLP):** The security principle that dictates users, processes, and applications should be granted only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their work.

**Maintenance Hook:** An unauthorized or undocumented entry point left in a program or system, typically by a developer, which can be exploited by an attacker (a type of backdoor).

**Non-Repudiation:** The ability to ensure that a party to a transaction or communication cannot convincingly deny having participated.

**Open Source Software (OSS):** Software whose source code is made publicly available for use and modification, requiring careful vulnerability management.

**Operational Controls:** Security mechanisms that focus on the everyday functions and procedures of security within a system (e.g., security awareness training).

**Peer Review:** A structured process where a developer's work (code, design, or documentation) is examined by others to identify potential defects.

**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):** A process used to identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with the processing, collection, use, and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

**Provisioning:** The process of setting up and granting a user, system, or application access to required resources and services.

**Regression Testing:** Testing conducted after a change or fix to ensure that the new functionality has not introduced new defects or broken existing functionality.

**Release Management:** The process of planning, scheduling, and controlling the build, test, and deployment of software releases and patches.

**Requirement Elicitation:** The process of gathering and defining the detailed security needs and expectations of the stakeholders for a system.

**Risk Acceptance:** The decision to acknowledge a specific risk and not take any action to reduce it, often due to low impact or high mitigation cost.

**Risk Analysis:** The process of identifying the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities and determining the potential impact of a security incident.

**Risk Mitigation:** The process of applying security controls to reduce the probability or impact of a potential risk.

**Sanitization:** The process of completely and irreversibly destroying or removing data from a storage medium, making it unrecoverable.

**Secure Coding Guidelines:** A set of rules and best practices developers follow to avoid introducing security vulnerabilities during code creation.

**Security Architecture:** The structure of a system's security components, including the principles and models used to design, implement, and test them.

**Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM):** A document that maps security requirements to the corresponding design, code, and test cases to ensure all needs are met.

**Software Assurance (SA):** A high degree of confidence that the software functions as intended and is free of vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally introduced.

**Software Escrow:** A legal agreement where a third party holds the source code of a critical application; released to the customer if the vendor goes bankrupt or fails to provide support.

**Software Supply Chain Security:** Managing security risks introduced by external components, libraries, or services used in the development and operation of an application.

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** A non-runtime analysis technique that examines the application's source code, byte code, or binary code for security vulnerabilities.

**System Hardening:** See Hardening.

**Threat Modeling:** A structured process used to identify potential security threats, vulnerabilities, and counter-measures within an application's design or architecture.

**Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU):** A class of race condition vulnerability where a system checks a state (Time-of-Check) and then uses the result (Time-of-Use), but the state is changed between the two operations by an attacker.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** A systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system or network.

**White Box Testing:** Security testing methodology where the tester has full and complete knowledge of the application's code, structure, and internal workings.

**Zero Trust:** A security model requiring strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.
