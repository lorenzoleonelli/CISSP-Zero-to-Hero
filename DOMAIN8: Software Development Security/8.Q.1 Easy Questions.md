## Easy Questions ##

1. You are tasked with developing an application that needs to share various data types with other applications through APIs. Which data format would be the most suitable for this purpose?

A. XML

B. CSV

C. JSON

D. SPML

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. JSON

Explanation:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is lightweight and supports multiple data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. It is easy to read and write for humans and is natively supported by JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for web applications and APIs. Its simplicity and efficiency make it the preferred format for data interchange between applications.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. XML:
XML is more verbose and complex than JSON. While it supports schema validation and rich structure, it is heavier and slower to parse, which can be a drawback in performance-critical applications. It suits document-centric data better than lightweight data interchange.

❌ B. CSV:
CSV is primarily used for tabular data. It lacks support for complex data types, nested data, or hierarchical relationships, making it less versatile for sharing diverse data types.

❌ D. SPML:
SPML (Service Provisioning Markup Language) is designed specifically for provisioning and managing user identities and resources. It is not a general-purpose data format, making it less suitable for sharing various data types across multiple applications.

2. In a high-security environment where protecting sensitive data is critical, which of the following container runtime security practices should be prioritized to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy?

A. Protecting all containers with MFA

B. Using an AI-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

C. Encrypting all data stored within containers using container runtime encryption

D. Storing containers in different Physical or Virtual machines

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. Encrypting all data stored within containers using container runtime encryption

Explanation:
Runtime refers to the phase when a program is actively running within its environment. Encrypting data inside containers ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains protected and unreadable without the decryption key. This directly safeguards data privacy and mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access—crucial in high-security environments.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Protecting all containers with MFA:
MFA enhances user authentication but does not protect data privacy during runtime.

❌ B. Using an AI-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):
EDR focuses on detecting suspicious activities but does not directly secure data within containers. It’s a complementary measure rather than a primary method for runtime data protection.

❌ D. Storing containers in different Physical or Virtual machines:
Isolation can limit breach scope but is inefficient and does not inherently secure data inside containers.

3. You’re the lead security engineer for a company rolling out a new microservices-based application, and your priority is to ensure that each microservice, running in its own isolated environment, communicates securely with others. To achieve the highest level of protection against unauthorized access between these services, which security approach should you prioritize?

A. Adopt mutual TLS (mTLS) to enable robust service-to-service authentication and encryption, securing all microservice interactions.

B. Implement network segmentation policies using NAT to strictly isolate and control communication between microservices.

C. Set up API gateways with rate limiting to monitor and manage incoming traffic to each microservice, preventing potential abuse or overload.

D. Configure OAuth for seamless sharing of authorizations between microservices, streamlining secure access.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. Adopt mutual TLS (mTLS) to enable robust service-to-service authentication and encryption, securing all microservice interactions.

Explanation:
mTLS provides strong, bidirectional authentication between communicating microservices, ensuring both client and server verify each other's identities. It enforces encryption, preventing unauthorized access and securing sensitive data during transmission. In a microservices architecture, mTLS effectively reduces the attack surface by tightly controlling which services can interact.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Implement network segmentation policies using NAT:
While helpful in isolating network segments, NAT does not provide authentication or encryption, so it cannot fully prevent unauthorized service communication.

❌ C. Set up API gateways with rate limiting:
API gateways help manage traffic and prevent abuse but do not provide the robust authentication and encryption needed between microservices.

❌ D. Configure OAuth for seamless sharing of authorizations:
OAuth is designed for user-centric authorization and is not optimized for service-to-service authentication and encryption in microservices, adding unnecessary complexity without sufficient security benefits.

4. Your organization has formed a Scrum team to create the E-Commerce website. Which of the following is correct?

A. The Daily Scrum shouldn't exceed 15 minutes

B. Scrum prioritizes prototyping to enhance predictability and manage risks.

C. The Product Owner is accountable for the team's deliverables.

D. The Project Manager should consistently engage with the customers.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. The Daily Scrum shouldn't exceed 15 minutes

Explanation:
The Daily Scrum, or stand-up meeting, is a brief synchronization meeting designed to last no longer than 15 minutes. This time limit keeps the meeting focused and efficient, helping the team stay aligned without unnecessary delays.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Scrum prioritizes prototyping to enhance predictability and manage risks:
Scrum encourages iterative development and frequent feedback but does not explicitly prioritize prototyping. The focus is on delivering potentially shippable increments during time-boxed sprints.

❌ C. The Product Owner is accountable for the team's deliverables:
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing product value and managing the product backlog, but the entire Scrum Team collectively owns the deliverables.

❌ D. The Project Manager should consistently engage with the customers:
In Scrum, direct customer engagement is primarily the Product Owner’s responsibility, not the Project Manager’s.
