## 2.1.1 Data Classification ##

Data is the lifeblood of any organization. From financial records to customer information, strategic plans, and trade secrets, the variety and volume of data are immense, even for small manufacturing companies. Protecting this data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction is not just good practice, it's crucial for survival. Data security strictly requires a proper data classification.

:link: Keep in mind what you learned in [1.2 Understand and apply security concepts](https://github.com/lorenzoleonelli/CISSP-Zero-to-Hero/blob/main/DOMAIN1%3A%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/1.02%20Understand%20and%20apply%20security%20concepts.md#121-confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-authenticity-and-nonrepudiation-5-pillars-of-information-security)

To understand the concept behind data classification you can think of it like sorting your clothes: you wouldn't throw your delicates in with your work boots, right? Similarly, data classification is the process of organizing data into categories that reflect its sensitivity and value. This careful categorization allows organizations to apply the appropriate level of security controls, ensuring that the "crown jewels" are kept under lock and key while less critical information can be accessed more easily.

By classifying data, organizations can:

- **Prioritize Protection**: Allocate resources effectively, focusing more stringent security measures on highly sensitive data. 
- **Facilitate Informed Decision Making**: Make data-driven decisions about security investments and policies. 
- **Meet Compliance Requirements**: Adhere to legal and regulatory frameworks like GDPR.
- **Reduce Risk**: Minimize the likelihood and impact of data breaches. 
- **Streamline Data Management**: Improve data handling, storage, and retrieval processes.

:necktie: There's no one-size-fits-all approach to data classification. Different organizations may use different schemes, but the underlying principle is the same: assigning a level of sensitivity that dictates the level of protection. 

Organizations use various criteria to determine the appropriate classification level for data. These criteria may include:
- The value of the data
- The age of the data
- The usefulness of the data
- The level of damage that could be caused if the data were disclosed
- Legal, regulatory, or contractual responsibility to protect the data
- Effects the data has on security
- Who should be able to access the data
- Who should be able to modify the data
- Who should be able to reproduce the data
- Lost opportunity costs that could be incurred if the data were not available or were corrupted

:link: [NIST SP 800-122, Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/122/final), provides recommendations for identifying and securing PII to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. It outlines risk assessment methods, security controls, and best practices for minimizing the collection, storage, and exposure of sensitive personal data.

:link: Protected Health Information (PHI) is defined by [HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) as "individually identifiable health information" that is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (electronic, paper, or oral). This includes information related to an individual's past, present, or future physical or mental health, healthcare services, or payment for healthcare, which can be linked to a specific person. 

The following Infographic tries to recap all the sensitive data you may encounter in organizations:

Some common data classification levels for commercial businesses include:

- Confidential: The most sensitive data, unauthorized disclosure of which could severely impact the company. Think trade secrets, financial algorithms, or strategic plans. 
- Private: Data that requires more than normal protection to ensure its confidentiality. Examples include employee records, medical information, or legal documents. 
- Sensitive: Data that requires special precautions but is not as critical as confidential or private data. Financial reports, marketing strategies, or upcoming projects fall under this category. 
- Public: Information that is generally available and poses no risk if disclosed. This might include company addresses, press releases, or product brochures

Military and government organizations employ a different classification scheme, reflecting the potential impact on national security. These are common military classification levels:

- Top Secret: Unauthorized disclosure could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security, such as jeopardizing military operations or revealing sensitive intelligence sources.
- Secret: Data that, if disclosed, could cause serious damage to national security. 
- Confidential: Information that could cause damage to national security if compromised. 
- Unclassified: Data that doesn't meet the criteria for classified information but may still require some level of protection. 
- Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Sensitive information that is not classified but requires safeguarding. 

| Environment               | Classification Level         | Description & Examples                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Commercial (e.g., business)** | **Confidential**           | Most sensitive data—trade secrets, financial algorithms, strategic plans. Unauthorized disclosure could severely impact the company.  |
|                           | **Private**                 | Data needing more protection than typical internal info—e.g., employee records, medical data, legal documents. |
|                           | **Sensitive**               | Important data still requiring special handling—e.g., financial reports, marketing strategies, upcoming projects.  |
|                           | **Public**                  | Freely shareable information—e.g., press releases, product brochures, company addresses. No risk if disclosed.  |
| **Military / Government** | **Top Secret**              | Unauthorized disclosure could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.  |
|                           | **Secret**                  | Disclosure could cause serious damage to national security. |
|                           | **Confidential**            | Disclosure could reasonably cause damage to national security.|
|                           | **Unclassified**            | Information not meeting higher classification criteria; still may require minimal protection. |
|                           | **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** | Unclassified but sensitive information requiring safeguarding under law, regulation, or policy. Includes export‑controlled technical data, contracts, and similar.  |
