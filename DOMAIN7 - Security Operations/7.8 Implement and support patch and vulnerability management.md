## 7.8 Implement and support patch and vulnerability management ##

Patch and vulnerability management is not sexy, but it’s one of the most crucial lines of defense in your security posture.
Unpatched vulnerabilities are often the root cause of major cyber incidents: not because we didn’t have the right tools. But because we didn’t follow through.

Before we go deeper, let’s draw a clear distinction between the two:
- **Patch Management** is the process of identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying updates (patches) to software and systems. Think of it as applying the band-aids.
- **Vulnerability Management** is the broader discipline that includes identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating weaknesses in systems — with or without patches. Think of it as finding the wounds, assessing their severity, and deciding how to treat them.

These two work hand in hand, but they are not interchangeable.

 *In 2017, Equifax suffered a breach that exposed personal data of over 140 million Americans. The root cause? A vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) that had a patch available two months before the breach occurred. They knew. But the patch wasn’t applied across all systems.Cybersecurity is a race between defenders and attackers. New vulnerabilities are discovered every day. If your organization is slow or inconsistent in addressing them, attackers will eventually find their way in. It’s not a matter of “if.” It’s math.*

Let’s explore how you actually build and support a functioning patch and vulnerability management process:

1. **Asset Discovery: Know What You Have:** You can’t patch or scan what you don’t know exists. Shadow IT (unofficial or unknown assets) is a major vulnerability vector.
- Maintain an asset inventory: hardware, software, OS versions, firmware, cloud services.
- Automate it where possible with tools like CMDB, NMAP, Active Directory, cloud asset scanners.

> 🔗 This is Clause 6 in ISO/IEC 27005: Context Establishment. Because patching an invisible server is like giving medicine to a ghost.

2. **Vulnerability Scanning:** The Security Thermometer: Once you know your assets, you need to check their health.
- Use authenticated vulnerability scans regularly (weekly or monthly), especially for critical systems.
- Leverage tools like Qualys, Nessus, OpenVAS, or cloud-native scanners.
- Understand false positives and context. A “critical” CVE on a sandbox server with no internet access may not be your top priority.

> ✓ Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact. Not all vulnerabilities need immediate patching. But all need visibility.

3. **Risk Assessment and Prioritization:**  Triage Like a Pro: Let’s say you scan your environment and find 432 vulnerabilities. Welcome to Tuesday.Here’s where risk-based prioritization saves the day:
- Is the system internet-facing?
- Is it business-critical?
- Is the vulnerability actively exploited in the wild (check CISA KEV list)?
- Can you mitigate without patching (firewall rule, disabling feature)?

4. **Patch Deployment:** The Balancing Act: Patching is simple… until you have 500 production servers, compliance SLAs, and a CIO who hates downtime.
A mature patch process involves:
- Testing patches in a staging environment (especially for business-critical systems).
- Change control approval, especially in ITIL-based organizations.
- Scheduled maintenance windows: Communicate with stakeholders.
- Rollback plans: Every patch should have an “undo” button.

:bulb: Automate patching for low-risk, high-volume systems (like user laptops). Save manual effort for complex or sensitive environments.

5. **Exception Handling:** Because Reality Happens: Not every system can be patched. Maybe it’s a legacy system running a critical app. Maybe the vendor doesn’t provide updates anymore. What then? Risk treatment isn’t only about fixing — it's also about compensating.
- Isolate the system in a VLAN.
- Monitor traffic with an IDS/IPS.
- Use firewall rules to limit exposure.
- Document the exception. Revisit it quarterly.
If you can’t patch it, cage it and watch it.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: A good patch and vulnerability process is never static: New assets appear, New CVEs are released (see NVD or vendor advisories), New exploits hit the news cycle.
Then set up:
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Alerts for zero-day vulnerabilities
- Metrics dashboards (e.g., time to patch, number of critical vulnerabilities open)
- Use these to adjust your process, advocate for more resources, and prove security maturity.

The following table recaps the the patch and vulnerability management lifecycle:

| Stage                | Purpose                  | Key Activities                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Asset Discovery      | Identify what to protect | Inventory, scanning, tagging                   |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Identify weaknesses      | Scheduled scans, authenticated scans           |
| Risk Assessment      | Prioritize treatment     | CVSS scores, business impact, threat intel     |
| Patch Management     | Apply corrective measures | Testing, approval, rollout, rollback           |
| Exception Management | Handle what can’t be patched | Isolation, mitigation, documentation         |
| Continuous Monitoring | Keep process relevant     | Intelligence feeds, KPIs, new vulnerabilities  |

### Open Questions ###

1. Why is asset discovery a foundational step in vulnerability and patch management?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Asset discovery helps identify what needs protection. If you don't know what systems, devices, or applications exist, you can't scan them, assess their risk, or apply patches. Unknown assets are often unmonitored and unpatched—prime targets for attackers. </details>

2. What role does a vulnerability scanner play in an organization’s security posture?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Vulnerability scanners detect known weaknesses across systems. They compare system configurations and software versions against databases like CVE or vendor bulletins to flag vulnerabilities, helping prioritize remediation. </details>

3. Why is risk-based prioritization important when dealing with vulnerabilities?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Risk-based prioritization helps focus limited resources. Instead of patching everything blindly, teams can address vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat based on asset value, exploitability, and potential impact. </details>

4. How can you ensure that patch deployment doesn’t disrupt production environments?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Testing patches in staging environments minimizes disruption. By deploying patches to test systems first, organizations can identify conflicts or issues before they affect critical operations, reducing downtime and errors. </details>

5. What are common reasons organizations delay or skip patching?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Patching can be delayed due to operational risk, lack of automation, or poor inventory. Businesses may fear breaking systems, lack visibility into what needs patching, or simply not have the staff or tools to apply updates promptly. </details>

6. What should be done when a vulnerability is known but no patch is available?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Apply compensating controls like firewall rules, isolation, or behavior monitoring. When no patch exists, reducing the attack surface and increasing detection mechanisms can help protect against exploitation until a fix is available. </details>

7. How does patch management differ in cloud environments compared to on-premise systems?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Cloud environments often shift patch responsibility. In SaaS or PaaS, providers typically handle patching; in IaaS or hybrid models, customers are still responsible. This changes processes but not the need for vigilance. </details>

8. What challenges do small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face in patch and vulnerability management?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> SMEs often lack dedicated security teams or mature processes. They may rely on manual updates, irregular scans, or vendor-driven patching, making them more vulnerable if they don’t adopt automation or managed services. </details>

9. Why is continuous monitoring essential even after patches are applied?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> New vulnerabilities can emerge at any time. Even after patching, systems can be exposed due to misconfigurations, newly discovered exploits, or missed assets. Continuous monitoring ensures gaps are identified quickly. </details>

10. How can strong documentation improve the patch and vulnerability management lifecycle?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Documentation supports audits, compliance, and incident response. By tracking what was scanned, patched, or deferred (and why), teams can show due diligence and respond more effectively if something goes wrong. </details>
