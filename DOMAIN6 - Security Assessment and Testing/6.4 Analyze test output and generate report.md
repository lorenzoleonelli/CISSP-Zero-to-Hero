## 6.4.0 Preface ##

> ℹ In cybersecurity, doing the technical work is only part of the job. Equally important is being able to clearly and professionally communicate what you’ve found, what it means, and what action is needed. That’s where security reports come in.

A security report is the main way a technical team shares the results of their assessments with managers, other departments, and outside stakeholders. Whether you’ve done a vulnerability scan, penetration test, breach analysis, or compliance review, a well-written report turns complex technical results into useful business knowledge. Without a proper report, even the best security testing can be ignored or misunderstood.
Good security reports help companies make better decisions, prioritize risks, show compliance to regulators, and create a clear historical record of past assessments. Security reports are also often used during audits, lawsuits, insurance claims, and even in incident response investigations. So writing them well is a key part of being a cybersecurity professional.
A strong security report is more than just a list of vulnerabilities. It needs structure and clarity. Let’s walk through the standard components:

| Section | Description | Key Points / Examples |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Executive Summary | Short “big picture” part for business leaders. | - Why the report was created<br>- Main findings in plain English<br>- Risk level (High, Medium, Low)<br>- Next steps<br>Needs to be clear, honest, and concise. |
| Assumptions | Lists starting conditions relied upon during testing. | - “The client gave full access to the internal network.”<br>- “Test done in a non-production environment.”<br>- “No social engineering performed.”<br>Sets limits for what results mean; real attackers may not follow these limits. |
| Scope | Defines what was tested and what was not. | - “Test covered company website, cloud database, internal file servers.”<br>- “Physical security excluded.”<br>Clarifies boundaries for findings. |
| Summary of Activities | Details actions performed during the assessment. | - “Vulnerability scan of 35 IP addresses using tool X.”<br>- “Manual testing of authentication mechanisms.”<br>- “Social engineering phone calls attempted.”<br>Gives context and effort level. |
| Findings or Issues | Core of the report listing discovered security problems. | - Clear description of the issue<br>- Potential impact if exploited<br>- Risk level (High, Medium, Low)<br>- Evidence (logs, screenshots, proof-of-concept)<br>Must be clear, factual, and professional. |
| Recommendations | Advice for fixing each finding. | - Technical staff: patch versions, configuration changes, hardening guides<br>- Management: policy improvements, training, investment suggestions<br>Without recommendations, the report tells what’s wrong but not how to fix it. |
| Appendices | Supporting material that would overwhelm the main report. | - Full scan outputs<br>- Tool configurations<br>- Detailed vulnerability descriptions from vendors<br>- Extra screenshots or log files<br>Keeps main report clean while providing full evidence. |

## 6.4.1 Remediation ##

In cybersecurity, finding a vulnerability or security issue is only the first step — the real value comes from fixing it properly. That’s where remediation plans come in. A remediation plan is a clear, organized strategy that outlines how to fix or reduce the risk of the security problems found during audits, tests, or real-world incidents.

> ℹ A strong remediation plan does more than just list the problems; it defines who is responsible, what action is needed, when it should be done, and how success will be measured.

For example, if a security report shows that a server has weak encryption, the plan would assign a team to update the server, define the target encryption standard, and set a deadline for when the change must be completed.

In many organizations, remediation plans must also consider business constraints. Sometimes fixing a vulnerability right away isn’t possible because of budget, system stability, or compatibility issues. In those cases, the plan should include temporary mitigations, like extra monitoring or firewall rules, until a permanent solution is deployed.

**Testing remediation** is just as important as planning it. Once a fix has been applied, it needs to be verified — not just assumed to work. This can be done by re-running the original security test (vulnerability scan, penetration test, code review, or manual check) to confirm the problem is gone. If the issue was about access control, for example, testers will attempt to access the system in the same way as before to ensure the patch really blocked the path.

In regulated environments, testing and documenting the remediation process is a must. Auditors often require proof that vulnerabilities were not only identified but also properly fixed and validated. A good practice is to create a closure report for each issue, including the fix, test evidence, and final approval from management or the security team.

> ℹ Remediation plans turn findings into actions, and testing ensures those actions actually solved the problem — both are critical to moving from “we know it’s broken” to “we know it’s fixed.”

## 6.4.2 Exception handling ##

Exception handling is a critical part of managing security in any system. It refers to the process of dealing with situations where a predefined rule, security measure, or protocol cannot be fully implemented, often due to a business need, technical limitations, or specific circumstances that require deviation from the normal security policies. In simpler terms, exception handling is about acknowledging that not every situation can be covered by a standard rule, and allowing flexibility when it makes sense to do so while still managing the risks appropriately.

For example, in a corporate network, a security policy might require all communications to be encrypted. However, there may be specific instances where encrypting the data is not feasible due to system limitations or business needs. In such cases, an exception can be granted to bypass this requirement but with certain risk management measures in place. Exception handling ensures that even when a security policy is not fully followed, the organization understands and manages the risk properly.

Performing exception handling is a step-by-step process that involves careful evaluation, approval, and monitoring. Here's how to handle exceptions effectively:

1. **Identify the Need for an Exception:** The first step is recognizing when an exception is required. This may happen when a security control cannot be applied to a specific system or scenario. For example, a legacy system may not support the latest encryption standards, or a cloud service might not comply with certain regulatory controls.
2. **Evaluate the Risk:** Once the need for an exception is identified, the risk involved should be assessed. This step involves determining how the exception will impact the security posture of the system and the organization as a whole. It involves looking at the potential threats that could arise from the exception and evaluating the likelihood and severity of these threats.
3. **Define Compensating Controls:** When an exception is granted, it’s critical to put compensating controls in place. These are alternative security measures that help reduce the risks associated with the exception. For instance, if encryption cannot be used for a specific process, additional monitoring and logging could be implemented to detect any abnormal activities.
4. **Approval Process:** The exception request needs to be approved by appropriate personnel. This may include system owners, security managers, and other key stakeholders who can make the decision based on the risk evaluation and compensating controls. Approval ensures that the exception is officially documented and that the associated risks are understood.
5. **Monitor the Exception:** Once the exception is approved and the compensating controls are in place, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure that the exception does not lead to any new vulnerabilities or threats. Regular audits and assessments should be performed to track the impact of the exception and ensure that it remains under control.

When managing exceptions, it’s important to document everything thoroughly to ensure that all decisions are clear and traceable. Proper documentation helps with accountability and supports auditing and compliance requirements. Here’s what should be documented for exception handling:

1. Risk Details: The risks associated with the exception should be clearly documented. This includes identifying the vulnerabilities that the exception introduces, the systems affected, and how the risk may impact the organization’s overall security posture. The documentation should outline the potential consequences if the exception is not properly managed.
2. Reasons for Exception: The reasons behind the exception should be clearly stated. This could include technical limitations (e.g., outdated systems), business needs (e.g., operational constraints), or regulatory issues (e.g., non-compliance with a certain standard). The justification for the exception helps others understand why it is needed and why it was considered the best option under the circumstances.
3. Compensating Controls: Compensating controls are the alternative measures that will be put in place to mitigate the risks associated with the exception. These controls are necessary to ensure that the exception does not leave the organization vulnerable. This section should list any additional security measures, such as extra monitoring, logging, or access controls, that will be implemented to safeguard against the risk.
4. Exception Approval: Every exception request must be formally approved. The approval process should be documented with signatures or confirmation from the appropriate personnel (e.g., security officers, IT managers, or executive leadership). This approval confirms that the exception has been reviewed and accepted with an understanding of the risks involved.
5. Time or Duration of the Exception: The exception should be time-bound, meaning it should be granted for a specific period, after which it must be revisited. Documenting the time frame helps ensure that the exception does not go unnoticed for extended periods, and there is a plan in place to eventually comply with the security requirement. If the exception needs to be extended, it should go through the approval process again.

## 6.4.3 Ethical disclosure ##

Web applications, websites, and services like APIs often have vulnerabilities. A growing community of security researchers, mainly ethical hackers, works to find and report these issues to the organization responsible before malicious actors can exploit them. This process, called responsible disclosure, aims to give organizations a chance to fix vulnerabilities before they are publicly exposed.

Organizations with web-based resources should be prepared for vulnerability disclosures from external researchers. Since these reports can come unexpectedly, it’s important to establish a clear disclosure policy. This policy should include guidelines on how vulnerabilities should be reported, how long the organization will take to respond, and whether there are any rewards or recognition for the researcher. It’s also essential to specify which security aspects are in scope for disclosure and which are out of scope, such as minor vulnerabilities or best practices that are not applicable to the organization’s needs.

As a researcher or ethical hacker, it’s important to follow these disclosure policies and avoid exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain. Vulnerabilities should always be reported to the responsible organization, not used for monetary or reputational advantage. The work should be conducted in good faith, and organizations should be given time to address the issue before any public disclosure is made. Ethical researchers should also ensure their actions comply with the law.

Many organizations now offer financial incentives for responsible disclosure, often through bug bounty programs. These programs encourage ethical hacking by rewarding researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Third-party services can manage these programs, providing access to a pool of verified security researchers and enhancing an organization's security testing strategy.
There are several scenarios for ethical disclosure that researchers and organizations must consider. The rules and laws for vulnerability disclosure vary by jurisdiction and can be complex, so it’s essential to seek legal advice. Some key scenarios include:

- Nondisclosure: Certain legal or contractual obligations may prevent disclosure, such as when revealing a vulnerability could interfere with an active investigation.
- Full Disclosure: Some argue that vulnerabilities should be immediately disclosed, but this can be controversial if it alienates vendors.
- Responsible Disclosure: This involves reporting vulnerabilities to the organization and giving them time to fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed.
- Mandatory Reporting: In some cases, vulnerabilities must be reported to authorities or law enforcement, depending on legal requirements.
- Whistleblowing: Researchers who feel ethically obligated to report a vulnerability may be protected by whistleblower laws, especially if they disclose dangerous or illegal situations.
