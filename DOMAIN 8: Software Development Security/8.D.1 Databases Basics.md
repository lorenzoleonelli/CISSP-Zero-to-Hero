## 8.D.1 Databases Basics ##

### What is a database ? ###

A database is like a super-organized digital filing cabinet. It’s a structured collection of data that stores information in a way that makes it easy to access, update, and manage. Unlike plain files saved randomly on a computer, databases are built to handle large amounts of information efficiently. They allow multiple people or applications to read and write data at the same time, without confusion or errors. While regular files just hold data, a database makes that data work for you.

Databases do a lot more than just store data. They scale to handle massive amounts of information as your needs grow. They enforce rules to keep your data clean and accurate. They protect your information by allowing only the right people to access it, and they help businesses and analysts spot patterns and make better decisions based on trends found in the data.

Behind the scenes, what makes all this possible is a special type of software called a **Database Management System**, or **DBMS**. This is the brain that handles everything a database needs to do. It makes sure data is saved correctly, pulled up when needed, and kept secure from unauthorized users. Some common DBMS tools you might have heard of are MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL.

A DBMS works with a few key pieces:

- **Data** is the core—the actual information being stored, whether it’s numbers, text, images, or even full files.

- **Schema** is like a map or blueprint—it defines how the data is structured, what fields are expected, and how different types of information relate to one another.

- **Queries** are how we interact with the data—basically, instructions (often written in SQL) that tell the database what to find or change.

- **Users** are the people or programs that use the database, each with specific permissions depending on their role.

For a database to be reliable, it needs to follow something called the **ACID** properties. These are four principles that keep data safe and accurate, even if something goes wrong like a crash or power outage.

-**Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing—if one part fails, the whole thing is rolled back.

-**Consistency** means data must always follow rules and constraints—no corrupt or half-finished records.

-**Isolation ensures** that multiple people working at the same time won’t mess up each other’s data.

-**Durability** guarantees that once something is saved, it stays saved—even if the system crashes right after.

Because databases are so important, working with them has become a major career path. Some people become **database administrators (DBAs)** who keep the system running smoothly and securely. Others are **data analysts** who dive into the stored information to find insights and trends. You also have **data architects** who design how a database should be structured, and **developers** who write the code to connect apps to the data. All these roles help organizations get the most out of their data while keeping it safe and organized.

### Types of Databases ###

Usually databases are categorized by how they store and organize data.

#### Hierarchical Database ####
This type stores data in a tree structure where each record has one parent but can have many children—think of a family tree or folders inside folders. It fits well when relationships are clear and one-directional, like departments under a company.

Hierarchical databases are fast and predictable but rigid—if your relationships change, restructuring is painful

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Company]
  A --> B[Department A]
  A --> C[Department B]
  B --> D[Team 1]
  B --> E[Team 2]
    classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Network Database #### 
This one is more flexible: a child can belong to multiple parents. Imagine students joining several clubs and each club with many students. It functions like a web of connections. It handles many-to-many relationships well but can get complex.

```mermaid
graph LR
  Student1 -- member --> ClubA
  Student2 -- member --> ClubA
  Student2 -- member --> ClubB
  Student3 -- member --> ClubB
    classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Relational Database ####
Today’s most common type: data is stored in tables made of rows and columns. Tables link to each other using keys (like employee ID or order number). This model is flexible, widely supported, and works well with SQL. Systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle use it.

```mermaid
graph TD
  TableA[Customers]
  TableB[Orders]
  TableA -->|customer_id| TableB
    classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Object-Oriented Database ####
Here, data is treated just like objects in your code—they include both data and methods. You store things like Person or Order as objects, not rows. This is used in applications where working with complex data types is common—like multimedia or software simulations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Person {
    +string name
    +string address
    +getAddress()
  }

  class Order {
    +int orderId
    +Person customer
    +calculateTotal()
  }
     classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```


#### NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases ####
This is a broad category covering databases that don't use the table-and-row model. It includes:

- Document stores (e.g., JSON documents in MongoDB)

- Key-value stores (like Redis)

- Wide-column stores (e.g., Cassandra)

- Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j)

Here’s a simple graph model for a graph database example:

```mermaid
graph LR
  Alice((Alice))
  Bob((Bob))
  Alice -->|FRIEND| Bob
  Bob -->|FRIEND| Charlie((Charlie))
    classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

These are great for unstructured or semi-structured data, scalability, and special use cases like building social networks or managing logs.

#### Cloud Databases ####
These run on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google) and can be relational or NoSQL. They offer auto-scaling, high availability, and ease of management. Ideal for agile apps or businesses without their own infrastructure.

```mermaid
graph TD
  ClientApp --> CloudDB[(Cloud Database)]
  ClientApp2 --> CloudDB
  CloudDB --> BackupService
classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```

#### Multi-Model Databases ####
These support more than one data model—like relational, document, and graph—within a single system. They let developers pick the best data model for each part of an app, all under one roof.

```mermaid
graph TB
  MultiDB --> Relational
  MultiDB --> Document
  MultiDB --> Graph
classDef center fill:#ffffff,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,font-weight:bold
    classDef node fill:#e0e0e0,color:#000000,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
```
