2. A bank's IT security administrator needs to ensure that software updates downloaded from the vendor's official website have not been altered or compromised by an unauthorized third party. Which of the following actions would be the most effective in verifying the integrity of these downloaded software updates?

A. Using a VPN to securely download the software updates from the vendor’s official website

B. Ensuring that the vendor is not listed on the PCI DSS blocklist before downloading the updates

C. Contacting the vendor directly to confirm the authenticity of the downloaded software updates

D. Comparing the downloaded software updates with a list of Tiger hashes provided by the vendor to verify their integrity

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ D. Comparing the downloaded software updates with a list of Tiger hashes provided by the vendor to verify their integrity
Hash values, such as Tiger, SHA-256, or MD5 (depending on vendor), act as unique digital fingerprints of files. By computing the hash of the downloaded software and comparing it with the official hash published by the vendor, the administrator can confirm the file’s integrity — ensuring it hasn’t been altered, corrupted, or tampered with during transit or hosting.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Using a VPN to securely download the software updates from the vendor’s official website:
A VPN protects the communication channel, preventing eavesdropping or interception, but it does not guarantee the file’s integrity. The file could still have been compromised before being placed on the vendor’s site.

❌ B. Ensuring that the vendor is not listed on the PCI DSS blocklist before downloading the updates:
Checking blocklists relates to vendor reputation or compliance, not file integrity. Even a compliant vendor’s file could be tampered with if their systems are compromised.

❌ C. Contacting the vendor directly to confirm the authenticity of the downloaded software updates:
A phone or email confirmation ensures that updates exist but doesn’t verify that your specific downloaded file matches the original, unaltered version. Without a hash comparison, this step is insufficient.

Explanation:
Integrity verification ensures that what you downloaded is exactly what the vendor published.
The Tiger hash comparison (or any cryptographic hash check) provides mathematical certainty that no modification — accidental or malicious — has occurred.
Other methods like VPNs and vendor verification improve trust and confidentiality, but they do not directly validate file integrity, which is the key control in this scenario.

A. Disable all non-essential devices in the network until their security configurations can be verified and secured

B. Conduct a thorough inventory of all devices in the network to identify those without secure defaults before implementing any changes

C. Immediately change the default passwords on all devices to complex, unique passwords and document the changes made

D. Schedule a company-wide training session on the importance of cybersecurity, emphasizing the risks associated with using devices with insecure defaults

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅  B. Conduct a thorough inventory of all devices in the network to identify those without secure defaults before implementing any changes
A comprehensive inventory allows the IT and security teams to understand the full scope of vulnerable devices, prioritize remediation actions, and plan systematic security improvements. This ensures resources are used effectively and all critical devices are addressed.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Disable all non-essential devices in the network until their security configurations can be verified and secured:
While this could temporarily reduce risk, it may disrupt operations and is not practical as a first step. It does not address the root cause or provide a clear plan for remediation.

❌ C. Immediately change the default passwords on all devices to complex, unique passwords and document the changes made:
Changing passwords is proactive but without knowing which devices exist, it may be inefficient and leave some devices unaddressed. Inventorying first ensures that no vulnerable devices are overlooked.

❌ D. Schedule a company-wide training session on the importance of cybersecurity, emphasizing the risks associated with using devices with insecure defaults:
Training is important for long-term security culture but does not immediately mitigate the risk of insecure devices and should follow technical remediation steps.

Explanation:
Before taking direct action, it is essential to know your environment. A detailed inventory identifies all devices, their configurations, and which are vulnerable due to insecure defaults. Once the scope is understood, remediation — such as changing passwords, applying secure configurations, and monitoring — can be executed systematically and effectively, minimizing operational disruption while strengthening security posture.

C. Ensure that traffic between IoT devices and servers is properly encrypted

D. Isolate all devices in a dedicated VLAN

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ B. Implement Over-the-Air (OTA) update capabilities
OTA updates allow administrators to remotely update firmware across all IoT devices efficiently. This ensures devices are patched and secured without requiring physical access, reducing the window of vulnerability from outdated firmware while maintaining device integrity.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Contact IoT device vendors for on-site support:
On-site support may be helpful in specific scenarios, but it is time-consuming and not efficient as a first step. OTA updates are faster and scalable for large IoT deployments.

❌ C. Ensure that traffic between IoT devices and servers is properly encrypted:
While encryption protects data in transit, it does not address vulnerabilities due to outdated firmware. Firmware updates are a higher-priority action to fix security flaws.

❌ D. Isolate all devices in a dedicated VLAN:
Network segmentation improves security by limiting exposure, but it does not update firmware. This can be implemented later as part of a layered security approach.

Explanation:
The most urgent action is to remediate vulnerabilities in the firmware. OTA update capabilities enable efficient, large-scale deployment of security patches to IoT devices. After firmware is updated, additional measures like encryption and network segmentation further strengthen the security posture of IoT deployments.

5. A financial services company is conducting a thorough assessment of its cryptographic protocols to align with regulatory requirements for safeguarding sensitive client data. Currently, the firm employs digital signatures to authenticate financial documents and ensure non-repudiation. To bolster the security and integrity of these digital signatures, which key management practice should the company prioritize implementing?

A. Apply the same key pair for both encryption and digital signatures to reduce the complexity of key management processes

B. Implement a rotating key strategy that regularly changes private keys to mitigate risks associated with key compromise

C. Store private keys on cloud storage for easy accessibility by all authorized personnel

D. Establish a robust public key infrastructure (PKI) to oversee the lifecycle of digital certificates used for signature verification

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ D. Establish a robust public key infrastructure (PKI) to oversee the lifecycle of digital certificates used for signature verification
A PKI provides the framework for issuing, renewing, and revoking digital certificates, ensuring that public keys used for signature verification are trusted and authentic. It strengthens the integrity of digital signatures, supports regulatory compliance, and mitigates risks such as impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Apply the same key pair for both encryption and digital signatures to reduce the complexity of key management processes:
Using the same key pair for multiple cryptographic functions compromises security. Private key compromise would affect both data confidentiality and digital signature integrity. Cryptographic best practices mandate separate keys for encryption and signing.

❌ B. Implement a rotating key strategy that regularly changes private keys to mitigate risks associated with key compromise:
Rotating keys improves security but is only effective within a robust key management framework like PKI. Without proper management, frequent key changes can cause operational confusion and gaps.

❌ C. Store private keys on cloud storage for easy accessibility by all authorized personnel:
Storing private keys in the cloud introduces significant security risks, even with access controls. Private keys should reside in secure environments, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), to prevent unauthorized access.

Explanation:
Digital signatures rely on asymmetric cryptography, where private keys are used for signing and public keys for verification. A PKI ensures proper lifecycle management of these keys and certificates, guaranteeing that digital signatures remain trustworthy, verifiable, and compliant with regulations. Other methods like key rotation or cloud storage alone cannot fully secure digital signatures without a structured PKI framework.

6. A financial institution is implementing secure messaging protocols to protect sensitive transactions over its network, ensuring that the messages remain unchanged during transmission is critical. Which of the following actions would MOST effectively guarantee the integrity of these messages?

A. Utilizing SSL/TLS for network communication

B. Encrypting the messages with AES before transmission

C. Adding HMAC with a shared secret key to each message

D. Utilizing HTTPS for network communication

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. Adding HMAC with a shared secret key to each message
HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) ensures message integrity by combining the message content with a shared secret key and applying a cryptographic hash. The recipient can recompute the HMAC using the same key and compare it to the received HMAC. A match confirms the message has not been altered during transmission and verifies the authenticity of the source.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Utilizing SSL/TLS for network communication:
SSL/TLS secures the channel and provides confidentiality, but it does not guarantee the integrity of individual messages themselves once outside the secure session.

❌ B. Encrypting the messages with AES before transmission:
AES encryption ensures confidentiality, preventing unauthorized reading of the message, but it does not inherently verify integrity. Without an additional mechanism like HMAC, altered messages may go undetected.

❌D. Utilizing HTTPS for network communication:
HTTPS is HTTP over SSL/TLS. Like TLS, it provides secure transport and confidentiality, but it does not independently verify message integrity at the message level.

Explanation:
To ensure integrity, a mechanism must detect changes to the message content. HMAC achieves this by producing a cryptographic signature bound to both the message and a shared secret. While encryption and secure channels protect confidentiality and privacy, HMAC is the most direct method to confirm messages are unaltered during transit.

7. A bank is evaluating the integration of a third-party vendor for analytics services that will involve regular data exchanges. To minimize the risk of data leaks and ensure secure data transfer, which of the following measures should be prioritized?

A. Conducting a third-party risk assessment before integration

B. Implementing data tokenization techniques on sensitive data prior to exchange

C. Requiring the third-party vendor to have SOC certification

D. Establishing a symmetric-key dedicated VPN for secure data exchanges

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ B. Implementing data tokenization techniques on sensitive data prior to exchange
Data tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens, allowing analytics and operations without exposing the original data. Even if intercepted, tokens do not reveal sensitive information, minimizing the risk of data leaks and reducing compliance scope. This approach protects sensitive information directly during transit, while still enabling analytic operations.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Conducting a third-party risk assessment before integration:
While evaluating the vendor’s security posture is important, this does not actively protect the data being exchanged. Risk assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities but does not mitigate exposure.

❌ C. Requiring the third-party vendor to have SOC certification:
SOC certification indicates security best practices, but it cannot guarantee protection of sensitive data during transfer. It should be part of a broader security strategy, not the primary control.

❌ D. Establishing a symmetric-key dedicated VPN for secure data exchanges:
VPNs provide secure channels, but symmetric key management is challenging, and compromise of the key can expose all transmitted data. While VPNs protect in transit, they do not reduce the impact of potential interception, unlike tokenization.

Explanation:
Tokenization obscures sensitive data before it leaves your environment, providing proactive security against leaks and unauthorized access. It allows the third-party vendor to perform necessary operations without ever accessing the actual sensitive information, combining usability with strong security, which is critical for regulatory compliance and protecting client data.
