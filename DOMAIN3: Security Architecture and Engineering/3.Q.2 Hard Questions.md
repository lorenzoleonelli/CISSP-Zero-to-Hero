Correct Answers:

✅ A. Resolution: High resolution (e.g., 1080p or 4K) ensures clear and detailed images for identifying individuals or objects.

✅ B. Low-Light Performance: Critical for visibility in low-light or nighttime conditions.

✅ C. Video Compression: Efficient formats like H.265 reduce storage use without compromising quality.

✅ D. Field of View (FOV): A wide FOV minimizes blind spots and reduces the number of cameras needed.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ E. Camera Color: The color of the camera housing has no impact on surveillance performance.

❌F. Frame Rate Beyond 120 FPS: Ultra-high frame rates are unnecessary for standard surveillance and increase storage/bandwidth costs without significant benefit.

Explanation:
When choosing surveillance cameras for a secure environment like a data center, focus on image clarity, coverage, low-light performance, and storage efficiency. 
These directly affect your ability to monitor and respond to incidents effectively, while aesthetic or excessive performance factors (like color or extreme frame rate) do not contribute to security outcomes.
