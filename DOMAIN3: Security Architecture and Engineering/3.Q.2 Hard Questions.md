2. A bank's IT security administrator needs to ensure that software updates downloaded from the vendor's official website have not been altered or compromised by an unauthorized third party. Which of the following actions would be the most effective in verifying the integrity of these downloaded software updates?

A. Using a VPN to securely download the software updates from the vendor’s official website

B. Ensuring that the vendor is not listed on the PCI DSS blocklist before downloading the updates

C. Contacting the vendor directly to confirm the authenticity of the downloaded software updates

D. Comparing the downloaded software updates with a list of Tiger hashes provided by the vendor to verify their integrity

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ D. Comparing the downloaded software updates with a list of Tiger hashes provided by the vendor to verify their integrity
Hash values, such as Tiger, SHA-256, or MD5 (depending on vendor), act as unique digital fingerprints of files. By computing the hash of the downloaded software and comparing it with the official hash published by the vendor, the administrator can confirm the file’s integrity — ensuring it hasn’t been altered, corrupted, or tampered with during transit or hosting.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Using a VPN to securely download the software updates from the vendor’s official website:
A VPN protects the communication channel, preventing eavesdropping or interception, but it does not guarantee the file’s integrity. The file could still have been compromised before being placed on the vendor’s site.

❌ B. Ensuring that the vendor is not listed on the PCI DSS blocklist before downloading the updates:
Checking blocklists relates to vendor reputation or compliance, not file integrity. Even a compliant vendor’s file could be tampered with if their systems are compromised.

❌ C. Contacting the vendor directly to confirm the authenticity of the downloaded software updates:
A phone or email confirmation ensures that updates exist but doesn’t verify that your specific downloaded file matches the original, unaltered version. Without a hash comparison, this step is insufficient.

Explanation:
Integrity verification ensures that what you downloaded is exactly what the vendor published.
The Tiger hash comparison (or any cryptographic hash check) provides mathematical certainty that no modification — accidental or malicious — has occurred.
Other methods like VPNs and vendor verification improve trust and confidentiality, but they do not directly validate file integrity, which is the key control in this scenario.

3. The security department of a manufacturing company has recently discovered that many of the devices being used in their network lack secure default settings. These devices include routers, printers, and smart office equipment. As the CISO, you need to decide on the best approach to address this vulnerability. What should be your first course of action?

A. Disable all non-essential devices in the network until their security configurations can be verified and secured

B. Conduct a thorough inventory of all devices in the network to identify those without secure defaults before implementing any changes

C. Immediately change the default passwords on all devices to complex, unique passwords and document the changes made

D. Schedule a company-wide training session on the importance of cybersecurity, emphasizing the risks associated with using devices with insecure defaults

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅  B. Conduct a thorough inventory of all devices in the network to identify those without secure defaults before implementing any changes
A comprehensive inventory allows the IT and security teams to understand the full scope of vulnerable devices, prioritize remediation actions, and plan systematic security improvements. This ensures resources are used effectively and all critical devices are addressed.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Disable all non-essential devices in the network until their security configurations can be verified and secured:
While this could temporarily reduce risk, it may disrupt operations and is not practical as a first step. It does not address the root cause or provide a clear plan for remediation.

❌ C. Immediately change the default passwords on all devices to complex, unique passwords and document the changes made:
Changing passwords is proactive but without knowing which devices exist, it may be inefficient and leave some devices unaddressed. Inventorying first ensures that no vulnerable devices are overlooked.

❌ D. Schedule a company-wide training session on the importance of cybersecurity, emphasizing the risks associated with using devices with insecure defaults:
Training is important for long-term security culture but does not immediately mitigate the risk of insecure devices and should follow technical remediation steps.

Explanation:
Before taking direct action, it is essential to know your environment. A detailed inventory identifies all devices, their configurations, and which are vulnerable due to insecure defaults. Once the scope is understood, remediation — such as changing passwords, applying secure configurations, and monitoring — can be executed systematically and effectively, minimizing operational disruption while strengthening security posture.

A. Contact IoT device vendors for on-site support

B. Implement Over-the-Air (OTA) update capabilities

C. Ensure that traffic between IoT devices and servers is properly encrypted

D. Isolate all devices in a dedicated VLAN

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ B. Implement Over-the-Air (OTA) update capabilities
OTA updates allow administrators to remotely update firmware across all IoT devices efficiently. This ensures devices are patched and secured without requiring physical access, reducing the window of vulnerability from outdated firmware while maintaining device integrity.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Contact IoT device vendors for on-site support:
On-site support may be helpful in specific scenarios, but it is time-consuming and not efficient as a first step. OTA updates are faster and scalable for large IoT deployments.

❌ C. Ensure that traffic between IoT devices and servers is properly encrypted:
While encryption protects data in transit, it does not address vulnerabilities due to outdated firmware. Firmware updates are a higher-priority action to fix security flaws.

❌ D. Isolate all devices in a dedicated VLAN:
Network segmentation improves security by limiting exposure, but it does not update firmware. This can be implemented later as part of a layered security approach.

Explanation:
The most urgent action is to remediate vulnerabilities in the firmware. OTA update capabilities enable efficient, large-scale deployment of security patches to IoT devices. After firmware is updated, additional measures like encryption and network segmentation further strengthen the security posture of IoT deployments.

5. A financial services company is conducting a thorough assessment of its cryptographic protocols to align with regulatory requirements for safeguarding sensitive client data. Currently, the firm employs digital signatures to authenticate financial documents and ensure non-repudiation. To bolster the security and integrity of these digital signatures, which key management practice should the company prioritize implementing?

A. Apply the same key pair for both encryption and digital signatures to reduce the complexity of key management processes

B. Implement a rotating key strategy that regularly changes private keys to mitigate risks associated with key compromise

C. Store private keys on cloud storage for easy accessibility by all authorized personnel

D. Establish a robust public key infrastructure (PKI) to oversee the lifecycle of digital certificates used for signature verification

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ D. Establish a robust public key infrastructure (PKI) to oversee the lifecycle of digital certificates used for signature verification
A PKI provides the framework for issuing, renewing, and revoking digital certificates, ensuring that public keys used for signature verification are trusted and authentic. It strengthens the integrity of digital signatures, supports regulatory compliance, and mitigates risks such as impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Apply the same key pair for both encryption and digital signatures to reduce the complexity of key management processes:
Using the same key pair for multiple cryptographic functions compromises security. Private key compromise would affect both data confidentiality and digital signature integrity. Cryptographic best practices mandate separate keys for encryption and signing.

❌ B. Implement a rotating key strategy that regularly changes private keys to mitigate risks associated with key compromise:
Rotating keys improves security but is only effective within a robust key management framework like PKI. Without proper management, frequent key changes can cause operational confusion and gaps.

❌ C. Store private keys on cloud storage for easy accessibility by all authorized personnel:
Storing private keys in the cloud introduces significant security risks, even with access controls. Private keys should reside in secure environments, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), to prevent unauthorized access.

Explanation:
Digital signatures rely on asymmetric cryptography, where private keys are used for signing and public keys for verification. A PKI ensures proper lifecycle management of these keys and certificates, guaranteeing that digital signatures remain trustworthy, verifiable, and compliant with regulations. Other methods like key rotation or cloud storage alone cannot fully secure digital signatures without a structured PKI framework.

6. A financial institution is implementing secure messaging protocols to protect sensitive transactions over its network, ensuring that the messages remain unchanged during transmission is critical. Which of the following actions would MOST effectively guarantee the integrity of these messages?

A. Utilizing SSL/TLS for network communication

B. Encrypting the messages with AES before transmission

C. Adding HMAC with a shared secret key to each message

D. Utilizing HTTPS for network communication

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. Adding HMAC with a shared secret key to each message
HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) ensures message integrity by combining the message content with a shared secret key and applying a cryptographic hash. The recipient can recompute the HMAC using the same key and compare it to the received HMAC. A match confirms the message has not been altered during transmission and verifies the authenticity of the source.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Utilizing SSL/TLS for network communication:
SSL/TLS secures the channel and provides confidentiality, but it does not guarantee the integrity of individual messages themselves once outside the secure session.

❌ B. Encrypting the messages with AES before transmission:
AES encryption ensures confidentiality, preventing unauthorized reading of the message, but it does not inherently verify integrity. Without an additional mechanism like HMAC, altered messages may go undetected.

❌D. Utilizing HTTPS for network communication:
HTTPS is HTTP over SSL/TLS. Like TLS, it provides secure transport and confidentiality, but it does not independently verify message integrity at the message level.

Explanation:
To ensure integrity, a mechanism must detect changes to the message content. HMAC achieves this by producing a cryptographic signature bound to both the message and a shared secret. While encryption and secure channels protect confidentiality and privacy, HMAC is the most direct method to confirm messages are unaltered during transit.

7. A bank is evaluating the integration of a third-party vendor for analytics services that will involve regular data exchanges. To minimize the risk of data leaks and ensure secure data transfer, which of the following measures should be prioritized?

A. Conducting a third-party risk assessment before integration

B. Implementing data tokenization techniques on sensitive data prior to exchange

C. Requiring the third-party vendor to have SOC certification

D. Establishing a symmetric-key dedicated VPN for secure data exchanges

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ B. Implementing data tokenization techniques on sensitive data prior to exchange
Data tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens, allowing analytics and operations without exposing the original data. Even if intercepted, tokens do not reveal sensitive information, minimizing the risk of data leaks and reducing compliance scope. This approach protects sensitive information directly during transit, while still enabling analytic operations.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Conducting a third-party risk assessment before integration:
While evaluating the vendor’s security posture is important, this does not actively protect the data being exchanged. Risk assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities but does not mitigate exposure.

❌ C. Requiring the third-party vendor to have SOC certification:
SOC certification indicates security best practices, but it cannot guarantee protection of sensitive data during transfer. It should be part of a broader security strategy, not the primary control.

❌ D. Establishing a symmetric-key dedicated VPN for secure data exchanges:
VPNs provide secure channels, but symmetric key management is challenging, and compromise of the key can expose all transmitted data. While VPNs protect in transit, they do not reduce the impact of potential interception, unlike tokenization.

Explanation:
Tokenization obscures sensitive data before it leaves your environment, providing proactive security against leaks and unauthorized access. It allows the third-party vendor to perform necessary operations without ever accessing the actual sensitive information, combining usability with strong security, which is critical for regulatory compliance and protecting client data.

8. You are conducting a file integrity check as part of your organization's cybersecurity measures. During the process, you need to identify which actions will not affect the hash value of a file. Which of the following actions will not change the hash value of a file? (Choose all that apply)

A. Adding a blank character at the end of the file

B. Backing up the file

C. Copying the file

D. Changing a character in the file


<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

 Correct Answers:

✅ B. Backing up the file:
Creating a backup duplicates the file's contents exactly. Since no modification occurs, the hash remains unchanged.

✅ C. Copying the file:
Copying produces an identical duplicate of the file. The hash value depends on the contents, so an exact copy preserves the original hash.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Adding a blank character at the end of the file:
Even a single added character changes the file content, resulting in a different hash value.

❌ D. Changing a character in the file:
Any modification to the file content, no matter how small, produces a completely different hash value due to the sensitivity of hash functions.

Explanation:
Hash functions generate a unique fingerprint of a file's content. Any change, even a single character, will alter the hash, while operations like copying or backing up that do not modify the contents will preserve the original hash. This principle is critical for integrity checks and verifying that files have not been tampered with.

9. A data center experiences a fire, triggering the suppression system to activate. As the fire is contained, the team begins assessing the damage. While the fire is controlled, the equipment has sustained some damage. What is the most likely cause of the damage to the computer equipment in this scenario?

A. Smoke exposure

B. Human error

C. Suppression agent used

D. Excessive heat

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅  C. Suppression agent used:
Fire suppression systems, such as FM-200, CO₂, or other chemical agents, can extinguish fires effectively but may also damage sensitive electronic equipment. Some agents can cause corrosion or harm components if the area isn’t ventilated properly after discharge.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ D. Excessive heat:
The suppression system is designed to limit heat damage by extinguishing flames. While heat could be a factor, it is less likely the primary cause if the fire was controlled quickly.

❌ B. Human error:
Human mistakes could contribute to indirect damage (like mishandling equipment), but this scenario focuses on fire suppression, making human error a secondary concern.

❌ A. Smoke exposure:
Smoke can leave residue and cause long-term effects, but the immediate, primary damage in this case is usually due to the suppression agent rather than smoke itself.

Explanation:
Fire suppression systems protect lives and infrastructure by extinguishing fires quickly. However, the chemicals or gases used can negatively affect electronics, sometimes causing corrosion or component damage. Understanding the trade-offs between fire suppression and equipment safety is critical for data center design and post-incident response.

10. Symmetric cryptography is a cryptographic method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. Which of the following are possible key-exchange techniques in symmetric cryptography?

A. Public Key Infrastructure, Private Key Infrastructure

B. Elliptic-curve, SHA-256

C. Out of band, Asymmetric (Hybrid), Quantum

D. In band, Asymmetric (Hybrid), Quantum

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. Out of band, Asymmetric (Hybrid), Quantum
Key exchange in symmetric cryptography requires securely sharing the same secret key between parties.

Out of band: Uses a separate secure channel (e.g., postal mail, phone call) to exchange the symmetric key safely.

Asymmetric (Hybrid): Employs asymmetric encryption to transmit the symmetric key securely, then uses symmetric encryption for fast data transfer.

Quantum: Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages quantum mechanics to detect any eavesdropping, ensuring secure key exchange.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ D. In band, Asymmetric (Hybrid), Quantum
"In band" key exchange uses the same channel as the data transmission (e.g., internet), which is less secure because the key could be intercepted.

❌ A. Public Key Infrastructure, Private Key Infrastructure
PKI and private key infrastructures are frameworks for asymmetric key management, not symmetric key exchange.

❌ B. Elliptic-curve, SHA-256
ECC is used for asymmetric encryption, not symmetric. SHA-256 is a hashing algorithm and does not handle key exchange.

Explanation:
In symmetric cryptography, the security of the communication relies entirely on safely sharing the secret key. Out-of-band channels, hybrid asymmetric methods, and quantum key distribution are practical techniques to securely exchange symmetric keys. In-band exchanges and purely asymmetric or hashing frameworks do not directly address symmetric key sharing securely.

11. You’re setting up a secure connection between a client and a server using SSL/TLS. During certificate validation, which of the following does NOT need to be verified by the client before trusting the server’s certificate?

A. The digital signature of the CA is authentic

B. The certificate has not expired

C. The certificate has not been revoked

D. The server’s public key is valid

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. The server’s public key is valid

The client does not need to independently verify the server’s public key. The certificate itself contains the server’s public key, and the authenticity of that key is guaranteed by the CA’s digital signature. Trust in the key comes from trusting the CA.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. The digital signature of the CA is authentic – Must be verified to ensure the certificate was issued by a trusted CA and has not been tampered with.

❌ B. The certificate has not expired – The client must check the validity period; expired certificates cannot be trusted.

❌ C. The certificate has not been revoked – Must check against CRL or OCSP to ensure the certificate hasn’t been revoked due to compromise or other issues.

Explanation:
During SSL/TLS handshake, the client validates the server certificate to establish trust. Verification includes checking the CA’s digital signature, ensuring the certificate is within its valid period, and confirming it has not been revoked. The server’s public key itself does not need independent validation because it is implicitly trusted through the CA’s signature.
