## Easy Questions ## 

1. You are tasked with improving physical security measures for a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system in a critical infrastructure facility. Considering the various components involved, which of the following would present the greatest challenges in ensuring robust physical security?

A. Data Acquisition Servers (DAS)

B. Human Machine Interface (HMI)

C. End User Backends

D. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Remote Terminal Unit (RTU):
RTUs often operate in remote, outdoor, or unmanned environments such as substations, pumping stations, or field sites. This makes them difficult to secure physically, as they are vulnerable to tampering, theft, or sabotage. They typically have fewer built-in security controls, and implementing robust barriers, surveillance, and intrusion detection is more complex due to their dispersed locations and maintenance access requirements.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Data Acquisition Servers (DAS):
These are usually located in secure, climate-controlled data centers or operational facilities. They benefit from strong physical protections like access controls, surveillance, and environmental safeguards, making them easier to secure than RTUs.

❌ B. Human Machine Interface (HMI):
HMIs are commonly found in secure control rooms where access is restricted to authorized operators. Physical risks are minimized through building security, locked enclosures, and supervised access.

❌ C. End User Backends:
These typically refer to administrative or management interfaces, where security relies more on logical and network protections (authentication, authorization, encryption) rather than physical barriers. Physical risks are comparatively minor.

❌Explanation:
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is the most physically exposed component in SCADA environments. Because they are distributed across wide areas, often unattended, and difficult to monitor continuously, they present the greatest challenge for physical security. Effective protection requires creative solutions — including tamper-resistant enclosures, intrusion alarms, and remote monitoring — to mitigate both environmental and human threats.

2. You have implemented Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your web applications. Probably you have been recently a victim of...

A. Phishing

B. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

C. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)

D. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
CORS is used to define which origins (domains) can access web resources. While it doesn’t directly prevent CSRF, it plays an important role in mitigating cross-origin attacks by restricting unauthorized domains from making requests. When combined with CSRF tokens or referrer validation, it helps protect users from malicious, unauthorized actions triggered from other sites.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Phishing:
Phishing aims to deceive users into revealing sensitive data. CORS does not verify user intent or prevent fraudulent websites, so it offers no protection against phishing.

❌ B. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):
MITM attacks occur at the network level, intercepting communications between a client and server. CORS cannot defend against MITM — HTTPS and TLS are required for that.

❌ C. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS):
DDoS attacks flood a server with requests to exhaust its resources. CORS does not manage traffic volume or network load; firewalls, rate limiting, or DDoS mitigation services are needed for protection.

Explanation:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) controls how web applications handle requests from different domains. It’s particularly relevant when dealing with CSRF risks, since malicious sites can exploit browsers’ trust in existing sessions. By configuring CORS policies correctly and pairing them with CSRF defenses, developers strengthen web application security against cross-origin abuse.

3. A large financial services company is consolidating its data processing operations into a single, highly secure data center. Given the critical need to protect the data center’s perimeter, which security measure should be prioritized to detect potential unauthorized access attempts?

A. Install mantraps at all entrance points to control access

B. Build a high-security fence with barbed wire along the outer boundary

C. Install high-resolution CCTV cameras around the facility's perimeter

D. Deploy a PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor) based system

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅  D. Deploy a PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor) based system:
PIR sensors are designed to detect motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation emitted by people or animals. They serve as an effective real-time detection system for unauthorized movement near the perimeter. PIRs trigger alerts immediately upon detecting unusual motion, allowing for a rapid response to potential breaches. They are cost-effective, scalable, and can be combined with CCTV or alarms for verification and response coordination.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Install mantraps at all entrance points to control access:
Mantraps are effective for access control inside the facility but do not serve as detection mechanisms for perimeter intrusions. They prevent unauthorized entry rather than detect external movement.

❌ B. Build a high-security fence with barbed wire along the outer boundary:
Fences act as deterrents and physical barriers, not as active detection tools. While they help delay or discourage intruders, they do not generate alerts or notify security staff of attempted breaches.

❌ C. Install high-resolution CCTV cameras around the facility's perimeter:
CCTV cameras are useful for visual verification and post-incident investigation. However, without integration with motion detection or analytics, they rely on constant monitoring and do not inherently detect unauthorized activity in real time.

Explanation:
The question focuses on detection, not deterrence or access control.
A Passive Infrared (PIR) system directly supports detection objectives by identifying motion at the perimeter, offering immediate alerts that can be verified through CCTV or on-site guards.
While fences, cameras, and mantraps all contribute to a layered security approach, PIR sensors provide the first line of defense for early detection of potential intrusions — an essential component of a robust physical security program.

4. Given the cipher transformation where (Olssv Kbkl | 7) is decoded to read as "Hello Dude," what would the decoded message be for (Emmb Ctclgle qgp | -2)?

A. Good Morning sir

B. Good bye friend

C. Good Evening bye

D. Good Evening sir

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ D. Good Evening sir
This message is encoded using a Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
In this case, applying a shift of -2 (two positions backward) to “Emmb Ctclgle qgp” decodes it to “Good Evening sir.”

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Good Morning sir: Incorrect — the decryption of “Emmb Ctclgle qgp” does not match this phrase when applying a shift of -2.

❌ B. Good bye friend: Incorrect — this does not align with the character shift pattern used.

❌ C. Good Evening bye: Incorrect — partially matches, but the last word decrypts to “sir,” not “bye.”

Explanation:
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest forms of encryption, based on shifting letters of the alphabet by a set amount.

A positive shift moves characters forward (e.g., +7 shifts “H” to “O”), while

A negative shift moves characters backward (e.g., -2 shifts “E” to “C”).

In the example, the cipher (Olssv Kbkl | 7) decodes to “Hello Dude,” showing how a right shift of 7 works.
Similarly, decoding (Emmb Ctclgle qgp | -2) involves moving each letter two steps left, resulting in “Good Evening sir.”

5. A tech startup is developing a new application that will handle sensitive user data, including personal identification information (PII). As part of their security practices, the development team is focused on ensuring that the application fails securely to minimize potential risks. During a review meeting, the team discusses various approaches to implement this principle effectively. What should the development team prioritize?

A. Ensuring that the application defaults to a state that exposes minimal functionality in the event of a failure

B. Implementing a detailed logging mechanism that captures errors without revealing sensitive information to unauthorized users

C. Configuring the application to send all error messages directly to the data subject for immediate troubleshooting

D. Setting the default admin password to a complicated sequence of letters, numbers, and special characters

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ A. Ensuring that the application defaults to a state that exposes minimal functionality in the event of a failure
This approach follows the "fail securely" principle. By defaulting to a minimal functionality state, the application reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leaks, or other security breaches during failures. The focus is on limiting exposure and protecting sensitive information even when something goes wrong.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Implementing a detailed logging mechanism that captures errors without revealing sensitive information to unauthorized users:
While important for debugging and monitoring, logging does not directly prevent exposure during a failure. It supports overall security practices but does not substitute for secure fail-state design.

❌ C. Configuring the application to send all error messages directly to the data subject for immediate troubleshooting:
This is highly insecure, as it could expose sensitive information to unauthorized users. Error handling should provide generic messages to users and detailed logs only for internal review.

❌D. Setting the default admin password to a complicated sequence of letters, numbers, and special characters:
Strong default passwords help secure administrative access but do not control application behavior during a failure. This is part of secure defaults, not fail-secure design.

Explanation:
Fail-secure design ensures that when an application fails, it does so in a way that minimizes risk, limiting functionality and access. Other measures, like logging or strong passwords, enhance security but are secondary to the fail-secure principle, which is focused specifically on safe behavior during failure events.

6. In the context of computer security, a reference monitor is defined as an abstract machine that mediates all access requests between subjects (like users or processes) and objects (such as files or resources) to protect those objects from unauthorized access. It enforces access control policies and ensures that all attempts to access an object are checked against the defined rules. Which of the following options does not represent a characteristic typically associated with a reference monitor?

A. Verifiable

B. Tamper-resistant

C. Multilayered

D. Always Invoked

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. Multilayered
A reference monitor operates in a single, isolated layer of the system and is not inherently multilayered. The concept of multiple layers is more relevant to overall system architecture, not the reference monitor itself.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Verifiable:
This is a core characteristic. A reference monitor should be designed to be auditable and verifiable to ensure compliance with security policies and confirm its effectiveness.

❌ B. Tamper-resistant:
Correct characteristic. The reference monitor must be protected from unauthorized changes, as compromising it undermines the security of the entire system.

❌ D. Always Invoked:
Correct characteristic. The reference monitor must be invoked on every access request, ensuring no access occurs without proper authorization and enforcement of security policies.

🧠 Explanation:
The reference monitor concept ensures that all access attempts are checked consistently and securely. Its key properties—verifiable, tamper-resistant, and always invoked—guarantee reliable enforcement of security policies. Being multilayered is not a property of the reference monitor itself, which is intended to operate as a single, consistent control point within the system.

7. In the business class of an airplane, each seat is equipped with an embedded Raspberry Pi used for entertainment and internet browsing. The airline wants to enhance this system by allowing all Raspberry Pis to display certain flight data from flight control units, such as altitude, speed, outside temperature, and flight radar information. Which of the following solutions would be the most effective way to implement this feature securely?

A. Dedicated VLAN
B. Data Diode
C. Local Firewall on Each Raspberry Pi
D. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) on Raspberry Pis

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ B. Data Diode
A data diode enforces one-way data flow from flight control units to the Raspberry Pis, preventing any outgoing traffic from the Pis to critical flight systems. This ensures that flight systems remain isolated and secure, reducing the risk of cyber threats, unauthorized access, or malware propagation.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Dedicated VLAN:
While VLANs provide network segmentation and isolate devices, they cannot prevent outgoing traffic from the Raspberry Pis to flight control systems. Segmentation alone does not guarantee one-way data flow.

❌ C. Local Firewall on Each Raspberry Pi:
Local firewalls can control traffic, but a misconfiguration could allow unauthorized communication. They do not enforce strict one-way traffic like a data diode and managing multiple firewalls increases complexity.

❌ D. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) on Raspberry Pis:
EDR solutions focus on detecting and responding to malware or intrusions on individual devices but cannot prevent outgoing data flows to sensitive systems. They provide monitoring but do not enforce unidirectional traffic.

Explanation:
For critical systems, ensuring one-way data transfer is essential to prevent any compromise of flight control units. A data diode is a hardware-based solution that guarantees strict one-way flow, making it superior to VLANs, firewalls, or EDR solutions in scenarios where the integrity and security of critical systems must be preserved.

8. Authenticity refers to the quality or condition of being genuine, trustworthy, and accurately representing the origin, identity, or source of something. In various contexts, authenticity implies that a person, object, document, or information is legitimate, original, and not forged or altered. Which of the following indicates that a message has been tampered or modified?

A. The public key has been altered

B. The private key has become known

C. The message digest has been altered

D. The hashing algorithm has changed

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. The message digest has been altered
A message digest (hash value) uniquely represents the original content. If the digest changes, it directly indicates that the message content has been tampered with or modified, signaling a loss of integrity and authenticity.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. The public key has been altered:
While altering a public key can affect encryption or verification, it does not directly indicate that a specific message has been tampered. It may compromise verification, but the message itself could remain unchanged.

❌ B. The private key has become known:
Compromise of the private key affects confidentiality and authentication but does not directly show that a message was modified.

❌ D. The hashing algorithm has changed:
Switching to a different hashing algorithm changes how digests are computed, but does not indicate tampering of an existing message. It only affects future digest calculations.

Explanation:
The message digest serves as a digital fingerprint of the message. Any alteration of the message content will produce a different hash, making it the most reliable indicator of tampering. Authenticity and integrity are maintained by verifying that the message digest remains consistent with the original.

9. You are designing an architecture for a network that connects smart end devices to centralized services. The model you're considering needs to provide a hierarchical structure, addressing various aspects such as networking, computation, storage, and data processing. Which of the following models is hierarchical in nature and addresses networking, computation, storage, and data processing by connecting smart end devices to centralized services?

A. Cloud Computing

B. Edge Computing

C. Fog Computing

D. Smart Computing

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:
✅ C. Fog Computing
Fog Computing is a decentralized, hierarchical computing model that extends cloud capabilities to the edge of the network. It processes data closer to the location where it is generated while maintaining a connection to centralized services, providing low latency, real-time processing, and efficient management of networking, computation, storage, and data processing.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing is centralized, with data processing occurring in distant data centers. It does not provide a hierarchical structure that connects directly to local smart devices in real time.

❌ B. Edge Computing:
Edge computing processes data near the source device but typically does not include a hierarchical connection to centralized services. Its focus is local processing rather than hierarchical integration.

❌ D. Smart Computing:
Smart computing is a general concept for systems using intelligent algorithms and automation. It does not specifically describe a hierarchical model connecting smart devices to centralized services.

Explanation:
Fog computing sits between the edge and the cloud, creating a hierarchical network model. It is ideal for IoT and smart device networks, as it reduces latency, enhances real-time processing, and connects local processing to centralized services, unlike purely cloud or edge models.
