## 3.D.2 Understanding How Common IoT Sensors Work ##

IoT devices rely on sensors to perceive the physical world, converting real-world phenomena like temperature, light, or motion into electrical signals that can be processed. 
These sensors form the “eyes, ears, fingers and noses” of IoT systems, making it possible for industrial machinery and environmental monitors to interact with their surroundings.

**Temperature sensing** is one of the most fundamental tasks in IoT. Devices often use thermistors, which are resistive sensors that change their resistance as temperature changes. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors decrease resistance when the temperature rises, while positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors do the opposite. More precise sensors, like RTDs (Resistance Temperature Detectors), use materials such as platinum to produce a linear change in resistance with temperature. Semiconductor-based temperature sensors often provide a direct voltage or digital output, which can be read directly by IoT microcontrollers. 
Accurate temperature measurements are essential for thermostats, industrial monitoring, and environmental sensing, and calibration is key to avoiding drift over time.

**Humidity sensors** are closely related to temperature sensors but focus on detecting moisture in the air. 
Capacitive humidity sensors, one of the most common types, measure changes in capacitance caused by a hygroscopic polymer that absorbs water vapor. 
Resistive humidity sensors track the change in resistance of a moisture-sensitive material, while thermal conductivity sensors measure humidity indirectly by monitoring changes in air’s thermal properties. 
Because humidity often interacts with temperature, IoT devices frequently pair humidity sensors with temperature sensors to calculate absolute humidity. 
Over time, contamination or aging can affect these sensors, making recalibration important.

**Motion and position detection** are handled by accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. 
Accelerometers detect linear acceleration along one or more axes using tiny suspended masses in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) structures; the movement of these masses changes capacitance or generates piezoelectric signals. 
Gyroscopes measure angular velocity using the Coriolis effect on vibrating masses, also in MEMS devices. 
Magnetometers detect the strength and direction of magnetic fields, often serving as digital compasses in smartphones and wearables. 
To get accurate orientation and motion data, readings from these sensors are often combined using sensor fusion algorithms which help reduce noise and improve precision.

**Proximity and distance measurement** is another common requirement in IoT. 
Ultrasonic sensors send out sound pulses and calculate distance by measuring the time it takes for echoes to return. 
Infrared (IR) sensors can estimate distance by emitting IR light and measuring its reflection, using triangulation or time-of-flight methods. 
While ultrasonic sensors are sensitive to temperature and humidity, IR sensors can be influenced by ambient light or reflective surfaces.

**Light sensors**, including photodiodes and phototransistors, convert incoming light into electrical signals. 
When photons strike a semiconductor, they generate electron-hole pairs that create a current proportional to the light intensity. 
More advanced light-to-digital sensors provide direct digital readings, sometimes across multiple channels like red, green, blue, or infrared. 

**Gas and chemical sensors** detect the presence of gases like carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors rely on heated metal oxide surfaces whose resistance changes when interacting with gas molecules. Electrochemical sensors generate a current proportional to gas concentration through oxidation or reduction reactions at an electrode. These sensors are crucial for air quality monitoring, industrial safety, and environmental sensing. MOS sensors tend to consume more power due to heating, and cross-sensitivity to different gases is a common challenge.

**Pressure sensors** measure the force exerted by gases or liquids. Piezoelectric sensors generate voltage when mechanical stress is applied, while capacitive pressure sensors detect changes in capacitance as a flexible membrane deflects under pressure. MEMS-based barometers are often integrated with digital interfaces for IoT applications like drones, weather stations, and HVAC monitoring. Temperature compensation is frequently necessary to maintain accuracy.

**Sound and acoustic sensing** is typically handled by microphones, often in MEMS form for IoT devices. These microphones have a diaphragm that vibrates in response to sound waves, producing a measurable electrical signal. They are used in voice assistants, environmental noise monitoring, and industrial diagnostics. Because IoT environments can be noisy, filtering and proper placement are critical for obtaining reliable readings.
