Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format for unauthorized users while ensuring it remains accessible to those who have the proper credentials. It is one of the most fundamental aspects of cybersecurity, used to protect sensitive data, ensure secure communication, and verify identities.

The need for cryptography has existed since ancient times, from the early ciphers used by the Romans to modern-day encryption algorithms that secure online transactions and government communications. Today, cryptography is embedded in everything from email encryption and secure messaging apps to blockchain technology and cloud security.

Cryptography serves several crucial objectives in cybersecurity:

- **Confidentiality** ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable form (ciphertext), making it useless to attackers without the proper key.

- **Integrity** guarantees that information has not been altered during transmission or storage. Cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, create unique fingerprints of data, allowing users to verify its authenticity.

- **Authenticity** allows systems to confirm the identities of users and devices. Mechanisms like digital signatures and public-key infrastructure (PKI) help in verifying the legitimacy of communication parties.

- **Non-repudiation** prevents a sender from denying having sent a message. Digital signatures, combined with public-key cryptography, provide undeniable proof of message origin.
