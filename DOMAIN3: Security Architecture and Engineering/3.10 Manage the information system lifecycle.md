## 3.10.1 Stakeholders needs and requirements ##

In the information system lifecycle, identifying stakeholders’ needs and requirements is the first step in shaping a secure system. This involves engaging with key parties such as end-users, business leaders, IT personnel, and regulatory bodies to understand their expectations, security concerns, and operational goals. Stakeholders may express needs regarding system functionality, performance, availability, and compliance. Cybersecurity professionals need to assess potential risks tied to stakeholders' demands, balancing security and usability while ensuring compliance with industry standards. This step involves identifying data protection requirements, threat landscapes, privacy needs, and user access control expectations. Properly understanding and documenting stakeholders' security needs lays the foundation for a secure system design that mitigates risks and addresses compliance requirements.

## 3.10.2 Requirements analysis ##

Requirements analysis involves translating stakeholders’ needs into clear, actionable technical specifications that guide system design and security architecture. This phase includes identifying security requirements such as encryption needs, user authentication protocols, access control mechanisms, and threat detection capabilities. Cybersecurity experts analyze potential vulnerabilities based on the system’s intended use and environment. They also evaluate compliance with security standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR. Requirements analysis should consider the scalability, resilience, and adaptability of the system to meet future security threats. This phase requires careful risk assessment to identify critical threats, ensure proper controls are in place, and align with business goals while adhering to security best practices.

## 3.10.3 Architectural design ##

Architectural design in cybersecurity focuses on how security controls and components will be integrated into the system. This step involves creating an architecture that encompasses secure communication channels, robust authentication, and data integrity. Security architecture must address system vulnerabilities identified in previous phases and implement defense-in-depth strategies, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and encryption methods. Security experts ensure that the system is resistant to common attack vectors, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and SQL injection. The design should also prioritize high availability, disaster recovery, and network segmentation to limit the impact of security breaches. At this stage, stakeholders must review the design to ensure it meets all security requirements while remaining functional and cost-effective.

## 3.10.4 Development /implementation ##

The development and implementation phase is where the security plan comes to life. Cybersecurity experts collaborate with developers to ensure that secure coding practices are followed, minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, cross-site scripting (XSS), or inadequate input validation. Secure development involves regular security code reviews, static code analysis, and ensuring secure APIs. Authentication protocols, data encryption, and proper logging mechanisms must be built into the system. Integration of security tools such as web application firewalls (WAF) and antivirus software is also critical during this stage. Testing procedures must be designed to detect and correct security flaws before the system is deployed, ensuring all functionalities meet security standards.

## 3.10.5 Integration ##

Integration involves combining the newly developed components with existing infrastructure and systems. This stage requires a deep understanding of network security to ensure seamless communication between the new system and legacy systems while maintaining security controls. Experts need to ensure that proper security protocols (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs) are used in data transfer and system interfaces. The integration process should include checks for system incompatibilities and security vulnerabilities introduced by third-party software or services. Additionally, testing for secure integration—such as secure single sign-on (SSO) solutions or federated identity management—is necessary. During this phase, security teams should conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to confirm that the integrated system is resistant to exploitation.

## 3.10.6 Verification and validation ##

Verification and validation are critical steps in ensuring the security and functionality of the system before it becomes operational. This phase involves testing whether the system works as intended (verification) and whether it meets the security requirements set forth during earlier phases (validation). Security testing methods such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and fuzz testing are used to identify weaknesses. Verification ensures that the security features—like access controls, encryption, and audit logs—function correctly. Validation checks if the system meets regulatory compliance and user needs. This stage also includes stress testing under different attack scenarios to ensure the system’s ability to handle security threats under various conditions, ensuring its robustness and resilience.

## 3.10.7 Transition/deployment ##

Transitioning and deploying the system requires secure processes to ensure that the system operates as expected in the live environment. Cybersecurity professionals must ensure that all security configurations are correctly applied before deployment. Deployment includes setting up firewalls, anti-malware, and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Data migration and user access control mechanisms should be carefully executed to avoid data breaches during transition. During this phase, vulnerability scans are performed on the live environment, and all software components should be up to date with the latest security patches. Additionally, systems should be monitored for any immediate security incidents, ensuring that the deployment process doesn’t expose the system to unnecessary risks. A secure rollback plan should also be prepared in case issues arise post-deployment.

## 3.10.8 Operations and maintenance/sustainment ##

The operations and maintenance phase focuses on ongoing monitoring, patch management, and security updates to ensure the system remains secure over time. Regular security audits, threat intelligence updates, and vulnerability assessments are necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats. Cybersecurity experts perform proactive monitoring of systems using intrusion detection systems (IDS), log analysis tools, and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms. This phase also includes the application of patches to fix vulnerabilities identified after the system’s deployment. Additionally, incident response plans must be continuously tested, and recovery procedures should be refined as part of the business continuity planning process. Proper maintenance ensures that the system stays resilient against evolving cyber threats.

## 3.10.9 Retirement/disposal ##

Retirement and disposal of information systems require a secure process to mitigate any risks associated with data loss or exposure. When retiring a system, cybersecurity experts ensure that all sensitive data is properly sanitized, using techniques such as data wiping, degaussing, or physical destruction of storage media to prevent data leakage. A comprehensive risk assessment is conducted to determine how to safely decommission hardware and software while ensuring compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Additionally, the retirement process includes ensuring that all user accounts and access credentials are disabled or removed to avoid unauthorized access. Secure disposal also involves ensuring that any intellectual property or proprietary data is safeguarded to prevent misuse. The organization should also ensure the proper archival of important records as part of its compliance and legal obligations.
