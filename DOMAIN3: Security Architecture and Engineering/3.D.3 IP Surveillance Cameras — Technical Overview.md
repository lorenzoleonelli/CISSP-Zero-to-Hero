## IP Surveillance Cameras — Technical Overview ##

Modern IP surveillance systems are an essential part of physical and information security. Unlike traditional analog CCTV systems, IP cameras transmit digital video data over IP networks, enabling advanced features such as remote monitoring, analytics, and integration with other systems (e.g., access control or intrusion detection).

An IP surveillance camera system combines optical engineering, digital compression, networking, and information security. Proper camera selection, bandwidth management, and compliance with international standards ensure both effective monitoring and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of recorded data.

### Types of Cameras ###

**Fixed Cameras**: Fixed cameras have a stationary lens aimed at a specific area. They are cost-effective and ideal for continuous monitoring of defined zones, such as entrances or corridors.

**Bullet Cameras**: Named for their cylindrical shape, bullet cameras are designed for long-distance viewing. They are usually mounted on walls or ceilings and are equipped with weatherproof housings suitable for outdoor use.

Advantages: Long range, visible deterrent, easy to install.

Disadvantages: Limited field of view, prone to vandalism if not properly mounted.

**Dome Cameras**: Dome cameras are encased in a dome-shaped housing that conceals the direction of the lens. This makes them suitable for indoor environments and discourages tampering.

Advantages: Discreet, vandal-resistant, wide field of view.

Disadvantages: Limited zoom capability compared to PTZ cameras.

**PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) Cameras**: PTZ cameras can rotate (pan), move vertically (tilt), and zoom optically. They are used for dynamic monitoring, such as tracking individuals or vehicles.

Advantages: Large coverage area, remote control, high flexibility.

Disadvantages: Expensive, mechanical parts subject to wear, may miss events outside their active view.

**IP Rating and Environmental Resistance**: The Ingress Protection (IP) rating defines the camera’s resistance to dust and water.

Common ratings include:

- IP65: Dust-tight and resistant to low-pressure water jets.

- IP66: Dust-tight and resistant to high-pressure water jets.

- IP67: Can withstand temporary immersion in water.

- IP68: Suitable for continuous submersion (specialized cameras).

For outdoor installations, IK ratings (e.g., IK10) may also apply, indicating impact resistance against vandalism.

### Camera Lens and Image Sensor ###

**Sensor Format:** The image sensor (CMOS or CCD) determines image quality and light sensitivity. Common sensor sizes are 1/4", 1/3", and 1/2". Larger sensors capture more light, improving image clarity and low-light performance.

**Focal Length:**  The focal length (measured in millimeters) determines the field of view (FOV):

- Short focal length (2.8mm – 4mm): Wide angle, suitable for indoor rooms or parking areas.

- Long focal length (12mm – 50mm): Narrow field, useful for long-distance surveillance such as perimeter monitoring.

Motorized varifocal lenses allow remote adjustment of the focal length.

**Aperture:** The aperture (f-number) controls how much light enters the sensor. A lower f-number (f/1.4) means a larger aperture and better low-light performance.

**Resolution:** The aperture (f-number) controls how much light enters the sensor. A lower f-number (f/1.4) means a larger aperture and better low-light performance.
Measured in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080 for Full HD, 3840x2160 for 4K). Higher resolutions capture more detail but require more bandwidth and storage. Selection should balance clarity with system capacity.

**Dynamic Range:** The Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) capability allows cameras to handle scenes with both bright and dark areas (e.g., doorways, windows). A good WDR (>120 dB) ensures visibility in variable lighting.

### Compression and Transmission ###

**Compression Standards:** Video compression reduces file size by eliminating redundant data.

- H.264 (AVC): Common standard balancing quality and efficiency.

- H.265 (HEVC): Offers up to 50% better compression than H.264 at the same quality.

- MJPEG: Compresses each frame independently; high quality but large files.

- H.264+ / H.265+: Manufacturer-optimized variants for surveillance use.

Compression reduces storage requirements but may introduce latency or artifacts if over-compressed.

**Transmission Protocols:**

- RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol): Standard for streaming video over IP networks.

- ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum): Ensures interoperability between devices from different vendors.

- RTP/RTCP: Used for real-time data delivery and quality control.

- HTTP/HTTPS: For web-based access and control interfaces.

**Network Considerations:** Most IP cameras support PoE (Power over Ethernet), allowing both data and power through a single cable (IEEE 802.3af/at).
Use Cat5e or Cat6 cables for Gigabit transmission and managed switches for VLAN segmentation and QoS control.

### Bandwidth, Storage, and Memory Calculations ###

**Bandwidth Requirements**: Bandwidth depends on resolution, frame rate, compression, and scene complexity.

Approximate bitrate per camera (H.264, 30 FPS):

- 1080p (2MP): 2–4 Mbps

- 4MP: 4–8 Mbps

- 4K (8MP): 10–16 Mbps

Total bandwidth = (bitrate × number of cameras). Add 20–30% overhead for network management and peak usage.

**Storage Calculation:** Required storage (in GB) = (bitrate in Mbps × 3600 × 24 × days) / (8 × 1024)  

For example, one 4 Mbps stream for 30 days requires roughly 1.3 TB.

Use Network Video Recorders (NVRs) or dedicated storage servers with RAID protection for redundancy.

**RAM and Processing**: Each camera stream requires system memory for buffering and processing. For NVRs:

- Minimum 2 GB RAM for small systems (<8 cameras).

- 8–16 GB for larger installations or analytics features (e.g., motion detection, AI-based recognition).

GPU acceleration is recommended for high-density or AI-based systems.

### Standards and Compliance ###

**DORI (Detection, Observation, Recognition, Identification):** Defined by IEC EN 62676-4, the DORI standard helps estimate the distance at which a camera can perform key tasks:

| **Category**       | **Pixels/meter** | **Purpose**                   | **Example Use Case**        |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Detection**      | 25 px/m          | Identify presence or motion.  | Perimeter monitoring.       |
| **Observation**    | 62 px/m          | See behavior or actions.      | Entrances or hallways.      |
| **Recognition**    | 125 px/m         | Recognize known individuals.  | Access points, checkpoints. |
| **Identification** | 250 px/m         | Identify unknown individuals. | ATMs, secure rooms.         |


**ISO and IEC Standards:**

- ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management system; relevant for secure video data handling.

- IEC 62676 Series: International standard for video surveillance systems — defines interoperability, image quality, and network requirements.

- ONVIF Profiles (S, G, T): Define device capabilities for streaming, recording, and analytics.

**Cybersecurity and Data Protection**: Modern IP cameras must comply with organizational and regulatory frameworks:

- Use TLS/SSL encryption for HTTPS and RTSP streams.

- Enforce strong authentication and role-based access.

- Apply firmware signing and updates from trusted sources.

- Ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
