A risk matrix and a risk register are two foundational tools in cybersecurity risk management—they serve different but complementary purposes:

### What is a Risk Matrix ? ###

A risk matrix is a visual tool—typically a 3×3, 4×4, or 5×5 grid—that plots how likely a risk is to occur (likelihood) against how severe the consequences would be (impact).

Axes:

Y‑axis: Likelihood (e.g. Rare → Almost Certain)

X‑axis: Impact (e.g. Minor → Catastrophic)


| Likelihood \ Impact | 1 – Negligible | 2 – Minor | 3 – Moderate | 4 – Major | 5 – Catastrophic |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **5 Almost Certain**| Low            | Medium    | High         | Critical  | Critical         |
| **4 Likely**        | Low            | Medium    | High         | Critical  | Critical         |
| **3 Possible**      | Low            | Medium    | High         | High      | Critical         |
| **2 Unlikely**      | Low            | Low       | Medium       | High      | High             |
| **1 Rare**          | Low            | Low       | Medium       | Medium    | High             |

> 🔴 Critical = immediate attention  
> 🟠 High = prioritize mitigation  
> 🟡 Medium = monitor and consider action  
> 🟢 Low = acceptable / low priority

In cybersecurity, this helps security teams visually categorize risks—for example, a phishing campaign (likely × moderate impact) may be “High risk,” while a nation-state breach (rare × critical) is “Critical risk” .

### What Is a Risk Register? ###

A risk register is a structured log (often in a spreadsheet or GRC tool) where each identified risk is documented, scored, and tracked over time 

Typical columns include:

- Risk ID & Description

- Likelihood and Impact ratings (often numeric like 1–5)

- Risk Score (Likelihood × Impact)

- Current Controls and Mitigation Plans

- Owner, Status, Review Date, and Residual Risk after mitigation

### Cybersecurity Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description                       | Likelihood (1–5) | Impact (1–5) | Risk Score (L×I) | Risk Level    | Existing Controls             | Mitigation Plan                          | Owner         | Status         | Review Date |
|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| R001    | Phishing leading to credential theft | 4                | 4            | 16               | 🔴 Critical   | Email filter, SPAM blocking   | Implement phishing awareness training     | CISO          | In Progress    | 2025-09-30  |
| R002    | Unpatched server vulnerability     | 5                | 5            | 25               | 🔴 Critical   | Manual patching once per month| Automate patch management, weekly audits  | IT Security   | Planning       | 2025-07-15  |
| R003    | Insider data leakage               | 2                | 5            | 10               | 🟠 High       | Access controls, logging      | Review user privileges quarterly          | Audit Team    | Completed      | 2025-06-01  |
| R004    | Ransomware infection via USB drive | 3                | 4            | 12               | 🟠 High       | AV + USB blocking             | Deploy application whitelisting, disable USB | SOC Team     | Planning       | 2025-08-01  |

**Practical Example:**

A company identifies a ransomware risk:

Likelihood = Likely (4), Impact = Critical (5).

Risk score = 20 → placed in Critical zone.

They record it in the register, assign the CISO as the owner, and list mitigation: backups, network segmentation, and employee drills.

After controls, assign residual likelihood of 2 and impact of 4 → residual score = 8 (Medium risk).
