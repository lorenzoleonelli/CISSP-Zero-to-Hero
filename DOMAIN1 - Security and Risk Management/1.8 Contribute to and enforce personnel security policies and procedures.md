## 1.8.0 Preface ##

People are frequently perceived as the `weakest link` in any security framework. Regardless of the implementation of physical or logical controls, individuals can find ways to bypass, circumvent, or undermine them, or even disable them. Malicious actors regularly target users through phishing and spear phishing campaigns, social engineering, and various other forms of attacks. **Phishing** is a broad scam where attackers pose as trustworthy entities—often via email, text, or website—to trick individuals into revealing sensitive info like passwords or financial details. **Spear phishing**, on the other hand, is a highly targeted form of phishing: attackers research a specific individual or group and craft personalized messages that appear to come from someone they know or trust, dramatically increasing the success rate.

> ⚠ No one is immune to these threats. 

Once attackers gain access to an account, they can exploit it to traverse the network and escalate their privileges. However, with proper training and motivation, individuals can also serve as a crucial `security asset`, actively safeguarding not only their own interests but also those of the organization. Additionally, advancements in AI have minimized the gap between humans and computers, further influencing security dynamics (in future it won’t be possible anymore to define people as the weakest link in a security framework).

> ℹ Ensuring security starts before an employee even joins an organization. During the hiring process, it's crucial to define clear job descriptions and responsibilities to align expectations and minimize security risks.

A well-structured **job description** helps:
- `Outline security expectations` – Candidates understand their role in protecting sensitive information.
- `Support background checks` – Helps verify if a candidate’s experience and trustworthiness align with security needs.
- `Reduce insider threats` – By ensuring only qualified, security-aware individuals take on critical roles.

A well-defined job description should include:
- `Job Title` – Clearly identifies the role.
- `Duties & Responsibilities` – Lists specific tasks and expectations.
- `Required Skills & Qualifications` – Specifies expertise needed.
- `Security Responsibilities` – Defines how the role interacts with security policies.

**Job responsibilities** define the specific duties, tasks, and expectations assigned to a particular role within an organization. These responsibilities are crucial because they clarify what an employee is expected to do and, in a security context, help determine the level of access they should have to sensitive systems and data.

Including job responsibilities in the job description ensures:
- `Alignment with Security Policies` – Employees understand their role in protecting data and following cybersecurity protocols.
- `Reduced Risk of Insider Threats` – Clearly defined duties prevent unauthorized activities.
- `Consistency in Role Expectations` – Everyone understands who is responsible for what.

This table recaps the importance of Job Descriptions:

## 1.8.2 Employment agreements and policy driven requirements ##

An **employment agreement** outlines various aspects of employment, including `job responsibilities`, `compensation, benefits`, and `termination details`. In some cases, such agreements are for a specific duration, such as in contracts or short-term positions. They provide a structured framework for terminating underperforming employees when necessary. The comprehensiveness of an employment agreement correlates with decreased risks, such as the potential for wrongful termination lawsuits. 

Example employment agreements include non-compete clauses, codes of conduct like an `acceptable use policy (AUP)` [1.D.3 Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)](1.D.3%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy%20(AUP).md) dictating proper use of company resources, and `nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)`[1.D.4 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](1.D.4%20Non-Disclosure%20Agreement%20(NDA).md)  safeguarding confidential information from disclosure by current or former employees. These agreements serve to protect both the organization's interests and the employees' rights and obligations.

Furthermore, **policies centered on personnel are frequently reinforced by**:
- `Noncompete agreements (NCA)`.
- `Ethical guideline` and requirement questionnaires and agreements.
- `Agreements and controls governing vendors`, consultants, and contractors.

> ℹ Throughout an employee’s tenure at an organization, implementing strong access control mechanisms is essential to reduce risks such as fraud, unauthorized actions, or policy violations. Organizations achieve this by enforcing policies that limit access, distribute responsibilities, and regularly change roles.

Some possible controls to mitigate Personnel related risks are:

1. **Separation of Duties (SoD)**
This principle ensures that `no single individual has complete control over critical processes`. By dividing responsibilities among multiple employees, organizations prevent any one person from having unchecked authority, reducing the risk of fraud or policy breaches. For example, in financial transactions, the employee who requests a payment should not be the same person who approves and processes it.

2. **Job Rotation**
By `periodically rotating employees into different roles or responsibilities`, organizations can prevent fraud and insider threats. When employees know that others will review their work after a certain period, it discourages misconduct. Additionally, job rotation helps in cross-training employees, making teams more resilient to unexpected absences.

3. **Least Privilege**
This security principle ensures that `employees only receive the minimum level of access` necessary to perform their tasks—no more, no less. By restricting access rights, organizations reduce the attack surface and limit the damage a compromised or malicious user can cause. For example, an entry-level IT support employee should not have administrative rights over an entire network.

4. **Need to Know**
Closely related to the principle of least privilege, "need to know" `restricts access to sensitive or classified information` based on job requirements. Employees are granted access only to the specific information they need to perform their roles. For example, a marketing manager does not need access to payroll data, just as a system administrator does not need to view confidential business contracts.

![PersonnelSecControls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0595b930-a8ef-4890-a2de-3839baa933cc)


**UBA (User Behavior Analytics)** is a security approach that `analyzes patterns in user activities to detect anomalous or potentially malicious behavior`. Instead of focusing on traditional security events like failed logins, UBA monitors how users normally interact with systems and flags deviations that may indicate insider threats, compromised accounts, or data exfiltration attempts.
For example if an employee who typically accesses customer records during business hours suddenly starts downloading large amounts of data at midnight, UBA would flag this as unusual and potentially risky.

**UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)** `expands on UBA by including both user behavior and system entity behavior` (such as servers, IoT devices, or applications). This provides a more comprehensive security approach, detecting threats that involve both human actions and automated systems.
For example if a company server suddenly starts sending high amounts of data to an unknown external IP, UEBA can flag this, even if it wasn’t triggered by a specific user action.

Why Are UBA & UEBA Important for Companies?
- `Detecting Insider Threats` – Identifies unusual access patterns or privilege misuse.
- `Preventing Data Breaches` – Detects abnormal file access or exfiltration attempts.
- `Enhancing Threat Intelligence` – Complements traditional SIEM solutions with behavioral context.
- `Reducing False Positives` – Uses machine learning to differentiate between legitimate and suspicious behavior.
- `Improving Incident Response` – Provides actionable insights for security teams to respond quickly.
