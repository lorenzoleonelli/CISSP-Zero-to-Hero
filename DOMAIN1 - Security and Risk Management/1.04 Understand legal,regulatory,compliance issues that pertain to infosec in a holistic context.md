## 1.4.1 Cybercrimes and data breaches ##

:necktie: As a security professional, you are anticipated to communicate effectively with C-level executives, operational personnel, and external stakeholders such as lawyers. However, it is equally important to recognize your limitations and know when to seek legal advice when necessary.

Every organization should be addressing essential inquiries such as:
- What measures are in place to safeguard our information and assets?
- What are the information security challenges specific to our organization within a global framework?
- What is the current state of the threat landscape?

This scrutiny is crucial due to the lucrative nature of cybercrime, which often leads organizations to refrain from acknowledging victimization or pursuing cybercriminals.
While it's impossible to thwart every attack, implementing effective security measures can deter cyber intrusions by rendering them:
- Unprofitable
- Labor-intensive
- Cost-prohibitive

In essence, organizations must not present themselves as easy targets for cyber threats.

:necktie: You may never achieve complete invulnerability for your company, but it's essential to find the appropriate compromise to ensure your company is adequately protected.

Criminals may target computers directly or exploit them to facilitate traditional criminal activities. Whether driven by profit or notoriety, malicious actors can leverage readily available tools, requiring minimal technical expertise to inflict significant damage on the digital landscape. Moreover, with nation-state actors continuously enhancing their capabilities to target information and infrastructure, today's information security professionals face an increasingly challenging task in safeguarding their environments from compromise.

The laws highlighted in the following table pertain to federal regulations in the United States. It's important to note that nearly every state in the country has implemented legislation addressing computer security matters. Due to the internet's worldwide influence, many computer-related crimes transcend state boundaries, thus falling within federal jurisdiction and undergoing prosecution in federal courts. Nonetheless, certain situations may see state laws imposing more stringent regulations and penalties compared to federal laws.

Security professionals should possess knowledge of the legal aspects concerning software licensing agreements.
#### There are four prevalent types of license agreements in use today:
- Contractual license agreements involve a written contract delineating responsibilities between the software vendor and customer, commonly utilized for expensive or specialized software packages.
- Shrink-wrap license agreements are displayed on the exterior of software packaging and typically include a clause implying agreement upon breaking the shrink-wrap seal.
- Click-through (or browser wrap) license agreements, increasingly common, present contract terms either on the software box or within documentation, requiring users to actively acknowledge agreement during installation.
- Cloud services license agreements extend click-through agreements, often omitting written agreements and displaying legal terms on-screen for users to review, typically leading to users quickly clicking through without thorough examination.

| **License Type**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       | **Common Use**                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Contractual License**  | A written contract outlining responsibilities between vendor and customer.                                                                                            | Expensive or specialized software packages       |
| **Shrink-Wrap License**  | Terms printed on the software packaging; agreement is implied by breaking the shrink-wrap seal.                                                                       | Packaged, boxed software                         |
| **Click-Through License**<br>(a.k.a. Browser Wrap) | Terms are shown on-screen or in documentation; user must click “I agree” during installation.                                                                    | Widely used in downloadable/installable software |
| **Cloud Services License** | Extends click-through model; terms are shown on-screen during use or setup, often without a separate written contract. Users often skip reading.                     | SaaS and cloud-based services                    |

:brain: Remember the 4 types of license agreement: Contract, Shrink-wrap, click-through, cloud services.

Other used types of licenses are:
- **Perpetual License**: A one-time purchase that grants the user the right to use the software indefinitely, though support and updates may expire unless renewed separately.

- **Subscription License**: A recurring payment model (e.g., monthly or yearly) where the user can use the software only while the subscription is active, often including support and updates.

- **Open-Source License**: Allows users to access, modify, and share the software's source code under specific conditions set by licenses like GPL, MIT, or Apache.

- **Freeware**: Software that is free to use but usually closed-source and with restrictions on modification, redistribution, or commercial use.

- **Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)**: A custom agreement for large organizations that bundles multiple licenses and services under negotiated terms and pricing.

- **End User License Agreement (EULA)**: A legal contract that defines how the end user is allowed to use the software, including rights, restrictions, and liabilities.

- **Concurrent Use License**: A license that permits a specific number of users to access the software simultaneously, regardless of how many total users have it installed.

- **Named User License**: A license assigned to a specific individual, allowing them to use the software on multiple devices, but not transferable to others.

:bulb: In a written contract, the customer typically has the opportunity to actively participate in the creation of the contract by negotiating its terms and signing the final document. However, in shrink-wrap and click-through agreements, the customer's role is limited to accepting the terms of the contract as presented by the seller or service provider. These agreements are often presented in a pre-packaged format, such as when purchasing software online (shrink-wrap) or agreeing to terms and conditions before accessing a website or app (click-through). In these cases, the customer's only option is to either accept the contract as is or decline the offer.

## 1.4.3 Import/export controls ##

The identical computers and encryption technologies utilized in powering the internet and facilitating e-commerce possess significant potential as formidable tools when wielded by a military force. Country-based rules and laws concerning import and export controls are established to regulate the movement of products, technologies, and information across borders, typically aimed at safeguarding national security, individual privacy, and economic interests.

The Wassenaar Arrangement aims to enhance "international security and stability" by overseeing the transfer of conventional weapons like firearms, explosives, naval weaponry, and landmines, as well as dual-use items and technologies. In 2013, the agreement underwent revisions to encompass cyber weapons, which include malicious software, command-and-control systems, and Internet surveillance tools.
The **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)** is a US regulation designed to oversee the export of items listed in the United States Munitions List (USML), including missiles, rockets, and bombs, to maintain control over their dissemination.
The **Export Administration Regulations (EAR)** primarily addresses items intended for commercial use, such as computers and marine equipment, but also covers products with potential military applications, even if initially designed for commercial purposes.

## 1.4.4 Transborder data flow ##

For numerous years, authorities have aimed to control the transfer of data collected within their territories to foreign nations. In certain instances, regulations aimed to safeguard individuals' private information, while in others, the state's interest lay in accessing the data for legitimate governmental needs. The advent of cloud computing and extensive data collection by public and private entities has intensified scrutiny on the transfer of such information.

The global economy thrives on data, which serves as a fundamental component of trade, generating substantial revenue even when lacking privacy-related content. Moreover, data considered legal in one jurisdiction could be deemed illegal in another, making the safeguarding of data movement a major policy priority.

**Data Sovereignty** is the extent to which data is subject to the laws of a country, regardless of its storage location.Data sovereignty entails the recognition that data owners or controllers must be cognizant of pertinent regulations to ensure adherence and prevent breaches of restrictions governing data usage and processing. Depending on the jurisdiction, data owners may be required to demonstrate compliance with these regulations by accounting for their data. It's essential to understand that data sovereignty can transcend the borders of the country where the data is physically stored. For instance, data belonging to a European Union resident housed in the United States is subject to both EU and US data sovereignty regulations. It's crucial to distinguish data sovereignty from data privacy, as data privacy laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prioritize responsible data safeguarding for individuals, while data sovereignty determines the scope of these data privacy laws.

**Data residency** pertains to where data is physically stored and processed, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks based on its location. This concept is crucial in cloud computing and international data transfers, impacting data privacy, security, and compliance with local laws. Organizations must adhere to data residency requirements to maintain data sovereignty and protect privacy rights, as failure to comply can result in legal consequences and reputational harm.

**Data localization** involves storing and processing data within a specific country's borders, driven by regulatory, security, and national interest factors. It aims to exert control over data, enhance national security, ensure privacy, and support economic interests within the jurisdiction.

In summary, data residency outlines the intended geographical storage and processing of data, data sovereignty is about the rights and control over data based on the jurisdiction of the data storage and processing, and data localization mandates data to remain within a specific location and jurisdiction.

| Concept             | Definition                                                                                                  | Key Focus                             | Example                                                                                       | Distinction From Others                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Sovereignty** | The extent to which data is subject to a country’s laws, regardless of where it is stored.                | Legal jurisdiction and compliance      | EU citizen's data stored in the U.S. is still subject to EU laws.                            | Goes beyond physical location; relates to **who has authority over the data**, not where it's stored. Distinct from **data privacy**.                              |
| **Data Residency**   | The physical/geographical location where data is stored and processed.                                     | Location-based legal compliance        | An organization stores Canadian user data in Canadian servers to meet local legal standards. | Focuses on **where** data lives. Supports data sovereignty, but doesn't define legal control over it.                                                              |
| **Data Localization**| The requirement to store and process data strictly within a country’s borders.                             | National control and security          | India mandates that financial data of its citizens must remain within India.                 | A **strict form** of data residency. Legally enforces that data cannot cross borders. Often motivated by national security and economic policies.                   |

:bulb: CISOs and security professionals need to adopt a comprehensive strategy for data security. This begins by categorizing and charting the organization's data, pinpointing its storage and movement, and understanding its sensitivity, location, legal obligations, and business requirements. This analysis aids in recognizing data necessitating specific measures for residency, sovereignty, or localization, as well as third parties involved in managing the organization’s data.

In the following we recap the most common worldwide privacy laws. These privacy laws aim to protect individuals' privacy rights, establish accountability for organizations processing personal data, and promote transparency and trust in the digital ecosystem. Compliance with these laws is crucial for businesses operating within their jurisdictions to avoid significant financial penalties and reputational damage:

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union (EU) to regulate the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU and European Economic Area (EEA). It imposes strict requirements on organizations handling personal data, including consent for data processing, data subject rights, data breach notification, and obligations for data controllers and processors. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties, including hefty fines of up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher.

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: The CCPA is a landmark privacy law in the United States that grants California residents certain rights regarding their personal information. It requires businesses to disclose data collection and sharing practices, provide opt-out mechanisms for selling personal information, and allow consumers to access, delete, and control their data. The CCPA applies to companies meeting specific criteria, including those with annual gross revenues exceeding $25 million or those handling large volumes of personal information.

**Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) - China**: The PIPL is China's comprehensive privacy legislation aimed at regulating the processing of personal information within the country. It establishes principles for the lawful collection, use, processing, and transfer of personal data and imposes obligations on organizations to protect individuals' rights. The law introduces concepts such as explicit consent, data localization requirements, and heightened penalties for non-compliance, including fines of up to 5% of annual revenue or ¥50 million.

**Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)**: The POPIA is South Africa's data protection law designed to safeguard the privacy rights of individuals and regulate the processing of personal information. It sets out conditions for lawful data processing, data subject rights, security measures, and requirements for data breaches notification. Organizations must comply with POPIA's provisions, which include hefty fines and potential imprisonment for contraventions.

A **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** is a process conducted by an organization to assess whether personal data is adequately protected and to mitigate potential risks associated with it. The objectives of a PIA include identifying and evaluating privacy-related risks, determining appropriate controls to mitigate these risks, and ensuring organizational compliance with privacy regulations. 
The steps involved in a PIA encompass: 
- identifying the need for the assessment
- describing the data processing activities
- evaluating necessity and proportionality
- consulting relevant stakeholders
- identifying and assessing risks
- implementing measures to mitigate these risks
- documenting outcomes
- ongoing monitoring and review.

:bulb: The terms Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Data Privacy Impact Assessment, and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) are often used interchangeably, but they can have distinct meanings depending on the context and jurisdiction.
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA): A PIA is a process that helps organizations identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. It evaluates how personal data is handled to ensure compliance with privacy laws and to protect individuals' privacy rights. PIAs are commonly used in various countries, including the United States and Canada.
Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA): A DPIA is a specific type of impact assessment mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. It focuses on processing activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. The DPIA assesses the necessity and proportionality of processing and helps in identifying and mitigating risks to data subjects.
Data Privacy Impact Assessment: This term is less commonly used and can be seen as a hybrid of PIA and DPIA. It generally refers to an assessment that considers both privacy and data protection aspects, but its exact definition can vary depending on the organization's practices and the legal framework in place.

:brain: There is no need to remember the 8 standard steps of a PIA but it is mandatory to remember that a PIA is a process conducted by an organization to assess whether personal data is adequately protected.
