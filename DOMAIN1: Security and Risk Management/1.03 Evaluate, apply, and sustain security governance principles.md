## 1.3 Evaluate, apply, and sustain security governance principles ##

Security governance is the name commonly given to the  framework of practices and processes through which an organization plans, supports, evaluates, and manages its security efforts. 
Closely aligned with corporate and IT governance, it ensures that security initiatives are integrated into the broader goals of the organization. 
Effective security governance requires a holistic approach, embedding security into every aspect of the organization’s operations and aligning it with legislative, regulatory, and compliance requirements.

:necktie: Security must be baked in your company: in its software, processes, policies, departments and personnel.


:bulb: “GRC is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.”

GRC includes:

- Governance: Ensuring that organizational activities support the business goals.

- Risk : Identifying, analyzing, and addressing risks that could interfere with operations.

- Compliance: Adhering to laws, regulations, and internal policies.

Below you can find a short timeline of GRC:

**Third-party governance** refers to the oversight and management of external entities that interact with an organization. This includes vendors, contractors, partners, and service providers who access or handle sensitive data or systems. Third-party governance is critical because these entities often introduce additional risks that can impact the organization’s security.
Key aspects of third-party governance include:

- Risk Assessments: Evaluating the security measures and risks associated with third-party entities.
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Clearly defining security expectations and responsibilities.
- Continuous Monitoring: Ensuring that third-party compliance with security requirements is maintained over time.

Without robust third-party governance, an organization’s security can be undermined by vulnerabilities in its external partnerships.

**Documentation review** is a critical component of security governance, especially in the context of obtaining an **Authority to Operate (ATO)**. An ATO is a formal declaration that an information system is approved to operate within a specific environment, often required in government or highly regulated industries. Documentation review usually ensures:
- Accuracy and Completeness: Policies, procedures, and system configurations must be thoroughly documented to demonstrate compliance.
- Risk Identification: Gaps or inconsistencies in documentation can reveal potential vulnerabilities.
- Audit Readiness: Comprehensive documentation facilitates audits and inspections by regulatory bodies.

By conducting regular documentation reviews, organizations can validate that their security measures are effective and aligned with compliance requirements.

## 1.3.1 Alignment of the security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives ##

**Security management planning** ensures the proper development, implementation, and enforcement of a security policy, aligning security functions with the organization's strategy, goals, mission, and objectives. This process involves crafting and deploying security measures based on factors such as business cases, budget constraints, and resource availability. Employing a **top-down approach** is often the most effective method for security management planning, with upper management taking the lead in initiating and defining organizational policies. These policies serve as guiding principles for all levels of the organizational hierarchy. Middle management is tasked with refining the security policy into standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. Operational managers or security professionals then execute the configurations outlined in the security management documentation, while end users are responsible for adhering to all organizational security policies.

:necktie: A top-down approach in information security helps establish a culture of security from the highest levels of the organization down to individual employees, fostering a comprehensive and proactive approach to safeguarding sensitive information and assets.

The **Strategic Plan** serves as a durable, long-term blueprint that articulates the organization's security purpose, aligning it with the overarching goals, mission, and objectives. With a typical lifespan of approximately five years, contingent upon annual maintenance and updates, it remains a crucial framework for guiding security initiatives and includes a comprehensive risk assessment.

In contrast, the **Tactical Plan**, a mid-term strategy, furnishes details on achieving the objectives outlined in the Strategic Plan or can be formulated ad hoc in response to unforeseen circumstances. Typically viable for about a year, it provides a focused approach to executing the broader strategic vision.

The **Operational Plan**, on the other hand, constitutes a short-term, meticulously delineated strategy derived from the Strategic and Tactical Plans. Although its relevance is fleeting, necessitating frequent updates (monthly or quarterly), it serves as the cornerstone for operational activities, ensuring alignment with tactical objectives.

## 1.3.2 Organizational processes (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, governance committees) ##

Security governance is vital for organizations to address various aspects, including acquisitions, divestitures, and governance committees. 
In an **acquisition**, a company purchases another company's assets, resulting in the acquired company's dissolution. The acquiring company may choose to retain the acquired business's name. Conversely, in a **merger**, two companies combine assets to establish a new entity. Mergers are common when both companies possess comparable influence and scale. **Divestiture** involves either fully or partially selling off a product line, business unit, division, or subsidiary. It's often viewed as a preferred growth strategy over diversification, involving the complete or partial transfer of assets, personnel, facilities, and inventory. The primary goal of divestiture is to discontinue a business segment, freeing up resources for more advantageous and profitable ventures.

<img width="464" alt="mergers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdad079-74a7-462c-893f-60f53a65fc1a" />

Let's explore how these processes intersect with cybersecurity measures:

Acquisitions and Mergers: Acquisitions and mergers introduce heightened risks such as information disclosure, data loss, and downtime. Without proper security considerations, the risks associated with obtained products persist throughout their deployment lifecycle. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to conduct thorough evaluations and integrate security assessments during the acquisition process.

Divestitures: Divestitures involve selling off parts of an organization, necessitating stringent security measures to prevent data leakage and maintain confidentiality. Cybersecurity professionals must collaborate closely with business and legal teams to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, segmenting the Information Security Management System (ISMS) ensures compliance without revealing sensitive information during audits.

When assessing a third party for security integration, take into account the following procedures as effective chances to evaluate the 3rd party:
1. Conduct an On-Site Assessment: Visit the organization's premises to conduct interviews with staff and observe their operational practices.
2. Review Document Exchange: Investigate how data and documents are exchanged, along with the formal procedures for conducting assessments and reviews.
3. Review Processes and Policies: Request copies of security policies, processes, procedures, as well as documentation of incidents and responses for thorough examination.
4. Third-Party Audit: Engage an independent third-party auditor, accredited by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), to conduct an impartial review of the entity's security infrastructure based on Service Organization Control (SOC) reports.

**System and Organization Controls (SOC)** reports are independent audit reports that evaluate the security, availability, and compliance of an organization’s systems, particularly cloud service providers and third-party vendors. These reports are critical in risk management, vendor assessments, and regulatory compliance.
There are three main types of SOC reports, each serving different purposes:

**SOC 1: Financial Reporting Controls**
- Purpose: Evaluates controls related to financial transactions and reporting.
- Audience: Accounting and finance teams, auditors, and companies relying on a vendor for financial processing (e.g., payroll, accounting systems).
- Example: A payroll processing service undergoes a SOC 1 audit to prove its system properly calculates and processes salaries without errors.

**SOC 2: Security, Availability, and Privacy Controls**
- Purpose: Focuses on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of data (based on the AICPA Trust Services Criteria).
- Audience: IT, cybersecurity, and compliance teams evaluating third-party vendors.
- Types:
SOC 2 Type I: Evaluates security controls at a single point in time (design effectiveness).
SOC 2 Type II: Evaluates controls over a longer period (3-12 months) to verify operational effectiveness.
- Example: A cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) undergoes a SOC 2 audit to prove it secures customer data properly.

**SOC 3: Publicly Available SOC 2 Report**
- Purpose: A high-level summary of SOC 2 findings, meant for public distribution.
- Audience: Potential customers and stakeholders who want to confirm a company’s security posture without seeing detailed audit results.
- Example: A SaaS company publishes a SOC 3 report on its website to reassure customers about its security compliance.

SOC reports are a crucial part of third-party risk management and compliance.

There are two more important concepts to understand when talking about organizational processes: business enablement and process enhancement.
Business Enablement refers to the process of empowering an organization to take on new opportunities, markets, or capabilities. It involves leveraging technology, innovation, or strategic changes to open new possibilities. This concept goes beyond optimizing existing operations; it creates value by enabling activities or services that were previously out of reach.
Process Enhancement refers to improving existing processes to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance the quality of outcomes. This typically involves process re-engineering—redesigning workflows, systems, or operations to achieve better performance.

| Category     | Business Enablement                          | Process Enhancement                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**| Create new opportunities and capabilities     | Improve existing operations                 |
| **Focus**    | Innovation and new value creation             | Optimization and efficiency                 |
| **Approach** | Strategic and forward-looking                 | Tactical and performance-oriented           |
| **Examples** | Entering a new market <br> Launching new tech | Automating workflows <br> Reducing waste    |
| **Outcome**  | Expands business horizons                     | Boosts competitiveness and margins          |

Governance committees play a crucial role in overseeing organizational structures and practices (also during mergers, acquisition and divestitures). A governance committee is a group of stakeholders responsible for overseeing an organization's cybersecurity strategy, policies, and compliance. It ensures that cybersecurity efforts align with the organization's goals, risk appetite, and regulatory requirements.
Key Functions of a Governance Committee are usually:
- Strategic Oversight: Sets the direction for cybersecurity initiatives, ensuring they support business objectives.
- Policy Development: Approves and reviews security policies and ensures they are updated regularly.
- Risk Management: Monitors cybersecurity risks and ensures appropriate mitigation measures are in place.
- Compliance: Ensures adherence to regulatory and legal requirements for cybersecurity.
- Accountability: Assigns roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and holds teams accountable for implementation and performance.

:necktie: Security roles need to be in sync and cohesive with organizational structures. Certain companies may define and assign roles to oversee data, systems, and processes (e.g., data owner, system owner, process owner).

When talking about roles it is always important the difference between privacy and cybersecurity.

:bulb: **Privacy vs Cybersecurity.**  **Privacy** refers to the rights individuals have to control their personal information and how it’s used. It’s about ensuring that personal data is handled responsibly, often under specific regulations or laws. For example, when you fill out an online form, you may have the right to control who can access your data and how it's used, like opting out of marketing emails or requesting your data be deleted. **Cybersecurity**, however, is the practice of protecting data, networks, and systems from attacks, breaches, and unauthorized access. It includes technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard systems from threats like hacking or malware. For instance, encryption and firewalls help protect sensitive data from being exposed or stolen.
Cybersecurity is essential for achieving privacy because, without strong security measures, personal data is vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation, which would undermine the privacy protections put in place.

:bulb: The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is commonly misinterpreted as a "privacy law," but it’s actually a data protection law. It establishes rules for how organizations should protect the personal data of EU citizens, emphasizing the security and proper handling of data.
