## 1.12.1 Methods and techniques to increase awareness and training (e.g., social engineering, phishing, security champions, gamification) ##

Before initiating actual training sessions, it is imperative to establish security awareness among users. Once this foundational step is accomplished, training sessions can commence, focusing on instructing employees in their job tasks and ensuring compliance with security policies. All new hires necessitate some level of training to adhere to standards, guidelines, and procedures mandated by security policies. Education, on the other hand, involves a more comprehensive learning process, often associated with individuals pursuing certification or seeking career advancement. Employees should be equipped with knowledge about various threats such as phishing and the importance of secure practices in their roles, encompassing aspects like data encryption and physical asset protection. 

| Stage       | Objective & Scope |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Awareness** | Establish a security mindset before formal training begins. New hires first need to **understand why security matters**—recognize threats like phishing, safe data handling (e.g. encryption), and physical asset protection. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **Training**   | Once awareness is built, deliver **task-specific instruction** on job-related security practices and policy compliance. This is required for all new employees to meet standards and procedures. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **Education**  | Involves deeper, often role- or certification-based learning—ideal for individuals seeking career advancement or technical expertise beyond standard training. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |

Training should be mandatory and provided to both new hires and through regular sessions conducted yearly at a minimum. Additionally, routine operational security tests, including phishing simulations, tailgating exercises, and social engineering scenarios, are crucial for evaluating and enhancing security awareness. The concept of security champions has gained traction, designating individuals within teams to advocate for security measures, address areas requiring attention, and facilitate skill development among team members. Furthermore, gamification techniques are being employed to make training and education more engaging, incorporating elements like interactive games, score tracking, and rewards to incentivize participation and knowledge retention.

## 1.12.2 Periodic content reviews to include emerging technologies and trends (e.g., cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain) ##

Given the complexity of threats, effective training must be both pertinent and engaging. This necessitates regular updates to training materials and the methods used for testing and evaluation. Simply repeating the same phishing test campaign or utilizing identical approaches for security assessments lacks effectiveness. This principle extends to other training materials as well. Rather than solely relying on extensive security documentation, consider leveraging internal social media platforms, videos, and interactive campaigns to enhance training and awareness efforts.

## 1.12.3 Program effectiveness evaluation ##

Allocating resources, including both time and finances, is essential for assessing the effectiveness of the company's security awareness and training initiatives. Key performance indicators, such as the percentage of employees clicking on simulated phishing campaign links, should be diligently monitored. It's crucial to analyze whether the awareness and training efforts are successfully reducing these clicks over time. If not, a reassessment of the strategies may be warranted.
