## Locking Down RDP: Expert-Level Setup, Ports, Authentication & Monitoring ##

**1: Preparation & Environment Setup**

- Use a supported Windows edition (Pro, Enterprise, or Windows Server). Home edition doesn’t support incoming RDP.

- Install or enable Remote Desktop Services (on Server: via Server Manager → Roles & Features). Ensure NLA support (Network Level Authentication  is a security feature in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that requires users to verify their identity before a remote session is established)

**2: Initial Secure Configuration**

- Enable Remote Desktop, then check “Require Network Level Authentication (NLA)”. NLA ensures credentials are verified before session creation. 

- Allow RDP through Windows Firewall for private networks only. If multiple profiles exist, restrict carefully. 

**3: Harden Authentication & Identity Controls**

- Enforce strong password policy: minimum 16‑character passphrases with mixed-case, numbers, symbols; no reuse

- Enable MFA (two-factor authentication) using smart cards or authenticator apps to block credential theft

- Implement account lockout policies after 3–5 failed attempts with auto‑lockout durations. This thwarts brute-force attacks.

- Apply least-privilege: only specific user groups allowed; avoid granting RDP rights to local administrators unless necessary

Here is how you can pratically harden your server:

| Control Area     | Practice Step |
|------------------|---------------|
| Password Policy  | Enable `RelaxMinimumPasswordLengthLimits`, set minimum length to ≥16, enable complexity and password history |
| Audit            | Enable the `MinimumPasswordLengthAudit` policy and monitor Event ID 16978 on domain controllers to track shorter password usage |
| Lockout Policy   | In Group Policy, set account lockout threshold to 3–5 invalid attempts, account lockout duration around 15 minutes, and reset counter timer similarly |
| MFA for RDP      | Install Duo Authentication for Windows Logon & RDP, or deploy RD Gateway + NPS extension with Azure AD/Azure Entra ID MFA |
| Least Privilege  | Create an AD security group specifically for RDP access, restrict membership to only necessary users, avoid using admin accounts, and enforce via GPO local group membership |

**4 Network Layer & Port Configuration**

- Do not expose RDP directly to the internet. Use a VPN, IPsec, or RD Gateway over HTTPS (TCP 443)

- If possible change default port 3389 to a high, non-standard port (e.g. 3390+) in the Windows Registry and firewall rules. Restart required.

- Scope firewall rules to accept only VPN or trusted IP ranges, rejecting all other inbound connections.

**5 Encryption & Protocol Security**

- Ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is used by RDP; disable insecure versions deprecated in modern Windows.

- Enable on-session encryption, which RDP does by default but ensure it remains enforced.

**6 Client & Credential Handling**

- Avoid saving credentials in .rdp files unless strictly necessary. If used, store only on encrypted systems (e.g. BitLocker enabled).

- Prefer smart-card or certificate-based authentication over password storage. Use Credential Manager or centralized vaulting if needed.

- Always confirm VPN or RD Gateway connection is active before launching RDP clients.

**7 Monitoring and Logging**

- Enable Windows Event logging for RDP login attempts, session start/end, and failed authentications. Use built-in Event Viewer.

- Record privileged sessions, especially high-level administrative access, for auditing and forensic analysis.

- Use SIEM or monitoring tools to alert on login anomalies, unexpected IPs, brute-force spikes, or off-hours activity.

**8 Maintenance**

- Keep OS, RDP components, VPN, and MFA tools patched—especially to mitigate threats.

- Adhere to CIS or Microsoft ISG hardening guidelines for RDS configurations via automation where possible. 

- Disable RDP entirely on systems where it’s not needed. Remove the service if idle long-term.

- Train users and administrators on RDP security best practices: MFA, VPN use, credential management, phishing risks.

**Wrap up Checklist**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Install/enable RDP; require NLA |
| 2    | Open firewall port restricted properly |
| 3    | Enforce strong passwords + MFA + account lockout |
| 4    | Use VPN or RD Gateway; change port 3389 |
| 5    | Enable TLS encryption; disable weak protocols |
| 6    | Avoid saving credentials; use certificates/smart cards |
| 7    | Log, monitor, and record sessions |
| 8    | Patch regularly; disable unused RDP; educate users |
