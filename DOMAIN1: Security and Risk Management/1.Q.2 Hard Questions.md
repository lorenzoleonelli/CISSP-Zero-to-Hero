1. **During the Risk Assessment process, having compiled an inventory of all your assets, you now seek to assess their vulnerabilities. What factors should be considered in this evaluation? (Choose all that apply)**

(A) Only the asset owners should provide a list of applicable risks

(B) Every asset has one or more vulnerabilities

(C) Most valuable asset should be analyzed first

(D) If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B,C,D)**

When assessing vulnerabilities during the Risk Assessment process, it is crucial to consider all relevant factors, including the nature of each asset, potential vulnerabilities associated with them, and prioritization based on value. Risk is sometimes schematized as threat x vulnerability, so we can approximate that If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk.
It is not only the asset owners theat should provide a list of applicable risks.

2. **Due to a recent data breach, your boss consistently requests updates on Risk Assessment, demonstrating a highly conservative stance towards risks, aiming to prevent as many as possible and potentially over-mitigating them. What best characterizes this situation and how could you react ?**

(A) Your boss is risk prone with an high risk appetite, you should try to increase company's risk tolerance

(B) Your boss is risk averse with an high risk appetite, you should try to increase company's risk tolerance

(C) Your boss is risk averse with a very low risk appetite, you should try to decrease company's risk tolerance

(D) Your boss is risk averse with a very low risk appetite, you should try to increase company's risk tolerance

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (D) Your boss is risk averse with a very low risk appetite, you should try to increase company's risk tolerance**

Given the evident apprehension towards risk in the scenario, it may be advisable to raise the company's tolerance for risk.
Remember the following definitions:
Risk Appetite: Risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It reflects the organization's willingness to take risks to achieve its goals and is usually defined at the strategic level.
Risk Tolerance: Risk tolerance is the specific amount or type of risk that an organization is willing to withstand or tolerate. It represents the acceptable level of variation from the organization's objectives and is more focused on the operational and tactical aspects of risk management.

3. **Your boss has requested focused attention on safeguarding data integrity across all company databases. What actions does this entail for you?**

(A) Data in the databases could be modified only under specific circumstances.

(B) Data in the databases shouldn't be modified without authorization.

(C) Data in the database should remain secret.

(D) Data in the database shouldn't be accessible to anyone.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B) Data in the databases shouldn't be modified without authorization.**

The correct answer aligns with the boss's request to preserve data integrity, ensuring that any changes made to the data are authorized to maintain its accuracy and reliability.
Wrong Answers:

- Data in the databases could be modified only under specific circumstances. This answer introduces ambiguity regarding when data modification is allowed, which contradicts the need for focused attention on safeguarding data integrity.

- Data in the database should remain secret. While data confidentiality is important, the boss's request specifically pertains to data integrity, which involves ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data, not necessarily keeping it secret.

- Data in the database shouldn't be accessible to anyone. This answer goes against the principle of data usability, which is essential for the database to serve its purpose within the company. While access control is important for security, complete restriction of access is impractical and counterproductive.

4. **A countermeasure is a defensive action or tactic taken to mitigate or neutralize a threat or risk. What countermeasure listed below is the most efficient in preventing eavesdropping?**

(A) A shredder

(B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur

(C) Data hashing

(D) Cryptography

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur**

Limiting the places where sensitive conversations can take place reduces the likelihood of eavesdropping, as it minimizes opportunities for unauthorized individuals to overhear confidential information.

Wrong Answers:

- A shredder. While shredding documents can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information, it does not directly prevent eavesdropping, which involves secretly listening to conversations or communications.

- Data hashing. Data hashing is a cryptographic technique used to ensure data integrity by generating a fixed-size string of characters from input data. While hashing is an important security measure, it is not specifically designed to prevent eavesdropping.

- Cryptography. Cryptography involves securing communication by encoding messages to prevent unauthorized access or modification. While cryptography is crucial for protecting data during transmission, it does not directly address the issue of eavesdropping, which involves listening to conversations or communications without authorization.

5. **Which of the following attacks typically result in a reduction of availability?**

(A) Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(B) Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack

(D) Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack**

Power outages and hardware failures directly impact the availability of systems or services by causing them to become unavailable. Additionally, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks deliberately target the availability of services by overwhelming them with excessive traffic or requests, thereby rendering them inaccessible.
Wrong Answers:
Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: While power outages and hardware failures affect availability, a replay attack typically does not directly impact availability but rather focuses on compromising data integrity or confidentiality.
Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: Dumpster diving and replay attacks are not typically associated with reducing availability. Dumpster diving involves searching through discarded materials for sensitive information, which does not directly affect system availability. Replay attacks aim to manipulate data integrity or confidentiality rather than availability.
Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack: Dumpster diving and eavesdropping primarily pose risks to data confidentiality rather than availability. While a DOS attack directly targets availability, eavesdropping and dumpster diving are more focused on accessing sensitive information.

6. **What will be the increase in ALE (Annualized Loss of Expectancy) of an hurricane damaging your server room if the EF (Exposure Factor) increases by 10% and AV (Asset Value) and ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) remains unchanged ?**

(A) 1%

(B) 20%

(C) 10%

(D) Not enough data provided

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) 10%**

In the process of risk ranking, quantitative analysis involves determining the anticipated annual cost of risk to the organization, known as the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE). This can be computed using the formula:

ALE = SLE (AV x EF) x ARO

ALE =  (AV x EF) x ARO

Here, the acronyms correspond to:

AV: Asset Value - The estimated financial worth or value of an asset within an organization.

EF: Exposure Factor - The percentage of asset value likely to be lost in the event of a security breach.

SLE: Single Loss Expectancy - The anticipated monetary loss from a single occurrence of a security incident.

ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence - The estimated frequency or likelihood of a security incident occurring within a year.

ALE: Annualized Loss Expectancy - The projected annual financial impact resulting from potential security incidents, calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO.

7. **A project manager has requested that you review the Risk Register. Upon examination, you noticed it cannot be finalized due to the absence of the following information:**

(A) Threats exploiting the risk

(B) Risk Owner

(C) 3rd party audit

(D) Framework used for the assessment

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **(B) Risk Owner**

Assigning a Risk Owner is essential to ensure that someone within the organization takes responsibility for managing and mitigating each identified risk, fostering accountability and proactive risk management practices. This individual is tasked with monitoring the risk, implementing appropriate controls, and escalating issues as needed to mitigate potential impacts.
While threats, audits, and frameworks are relevant components of risk management, they may not always need to be directly documented within the Risk Register, as the primary focus is on identifying and managing specific risks and their associated mitigation strategies. However, these elements can inform risk assessments and help inform decision-making processes regarding risk management strategies. Overall, a comprehensive Risk Register should capture key information about identified risks, their owners, mitigation actions, and ongoing monitoring efforts to ensure effective risk management throughout the organization
