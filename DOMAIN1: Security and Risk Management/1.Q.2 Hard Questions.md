1. **During the Risk Assessment process, having compiled an inventory of all your assets, you now seek to assess their vulnerabilities. What factors should be considered in this evaluation? (Choose all that apply)**
(A) Only the asset owners should provide a list of applicable risks
(B) Every asset has one or more vulnerabilities
(C) Most valuable asset should be analyzed first
(D) If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk

Correct Answer: (B,C,D)

When assessing vulnerabilities during the Risk Assessment process, it is crucial to consider all relevant factors, including the nature of each asset, potential vulnerabilities associated with them, and prioritization based on value. Risk is sometimes schematized as threat x vulnerability, so we can approximate that If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk.
It is not only the asset owners theat should provide a list of applicable risks.
