## 1.Q.2 Hard Questions ##

1. **During the Risk Assessment process, having compiled an inventory of all your assets, you now seek to assess their vulnerabilities. What factors should be considered in this evaluation? (Choose all that apply)**

(A) Only the asset owners should provide a list of applicable risks

(B) Every asset has one or more vulnerabilities

(C) Most valuable asset should be analyzed first

(D) If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B,C,D)**

When assessing vulnerabilities during the Risk Assessment process, it is crucial to consider all relevant factors, including the nature of each asset, potential vulnerabilities associated with them, and prioritization based on value. Risk is sometimes schematized as threat x vulnerability, so we can approximate that If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk.
It is not only the asset owners theat should provide a list of applicable risks.

4. **A countermeasure is a defensive action or tactic taken to mitigate or neutralize a threat or risk. What countermeasure listed below is the most efficient in preventing eavesdropping?**

(A) A shredder

(B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur

(C) Data hashing

(D) Cryptography

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur**

Limiting the places where sensitive conversations can take place reduces the likelihood of eavesdropping, as it minimizes opportunities for unauthorized individuals to overhear confidential information.

Wrong Answers:

- A shredder. While shredding documents can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information, it does not directly prevent eavesdropping, which involves secretly listening to conversations or communications.

- Data hashing. Data hashing is a cryptographic technique used to ensure data integrity by generating a fixed-size string of characters from input data. While hashing is an important security measure, it is not specifically designed to prevent eavesdropping.

- Cryptography. Cryptography involves securing communication by encoding messages to prevent unauthorized access or modification. While cryptography is crucial for protecting data during transmission, it does not directly address the issue of eavesdropping, which involves listening to conversations or communications without authorization.

5. **Which of the following attacks typically result in a reduction of availability?**

(A) Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(B) Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack

(D) Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack**

Power outages and hardware failures directly impact the availability of systems or services by causing them to become unavailable. Additionally, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks deliberately target the availability of services by overwhelming them with excessive traffic or requests, thereby rendering them inaccessible.
Wrong Answers:
Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: While power outages and hardware failures affect availability, a replay attack typically does not directly impact availability but rather focuses on compromising data integrity or confidentiality.
Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: Dumpster diving and replay attacks are not typically associated with reducing availability. Dumpster diving involves searching through discarded materials for sensitive information, which does not directly affect system availability. Replay attacks aim to manipulate data integrity or confidentiality rather than availability.
Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack: Dumpster diving and eavesdropping primarily pose risks to data confidentiality rather than availability. While a DOS attack directly targets availability, eavesdropping and dumpster diving are more focused on accessing sensitive information.

6. **What will be the increase in ALE (Annualized Loss of Expectancy) of an hurricane damaging your server room if the EF (Exposure Factor) increases by 10% and AV (Asset Value) and ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) remains unchanged ?**

(A) 1%

(B) 20%

(C) 10%

(D) Not enough data provided

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) 10%**

In the process of risk ranking, quantitative analysis involves determining the anticipated annual cost of risk to the organization, known as the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE). This can be computed using the formula:

ALE = SLE (AV x EF) x ARO

ALE =  (AV x EF) x ARO

Here, the acronyms correspond to:

AV: Asset Value - The estimated financial worth or value of an asset within an organization.

EF: Exposure Factor - The percentage of asset value likely to be lost in the event of a security breach.

SLE: Single Loss Expectancy - The anticipated monetary loss from a single occurrence of a security incident.

ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence - The estimated frequency or likelihood of a security incident occurring within a year.

ALE: Annualized Loss Expectancy - The projected annual financial impact resulting from potential security incidents, calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO.

17. **Your company is transitioning several outsourced marketing operations in-house. What is the first action you should take in response to this decision?**

(A) Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

(B) Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

(C) Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all employee laptops.

(D) Ensure that all company data, whether stored, in use, or in transit, is encrypted.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B) Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).**

Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). A DPIA is essential whenever significant changes are made to data processing, especially in cases where data handling shifts from an external provider to internal management. This assessment will help identify potential risks to personal data and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, which is critical for protecting customer and company information as marketing operations transition in-house.

Incorrect Answers:

Ensure that all company data, whether stored, in use, or in transit, is encrypted. While encryption is vital for data security, it is not the first action to take in this situation. Encryption is part of a broader set of security measures, which would typically be considered after a DPIA identifies the specific risks and vulnerabilities associated with bringing operations in-house.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all employee laptops. Implementing MFA is an effective security control to protect access to sensitive information, but it is not the immediate priority in response to the decision to internalize marketing operations. A DPIA would help determine which security measures, including MFA, are most appropriate based on identified risks.

Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Appointing a DPO is only required under some circumstances. This role could be beneficial, but hiring a DPO is not the immediate step needed to address risks associated with internalizing marketing operations.

18. **When selecting an ERP platform for an international manufacturing company handling sensitive information, what is the key feature the security team should prioritize to ensure alignment with global data protection laws and standards?**

(A) Data availability

(B) Secure remote connections

(C) High granularity of sensitive information

(D) Data localization options

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (D) Data localization options**

Data Localization Options. Data localization is crucial because many countries have strict data protection laws requiring that sensitive information be stored within specific geographic boundaries. Choosing an ERP platform with data localization options enables the organization to comply with regulations like the EU’s GDPR, which mandates strict controls over where data is stored and processed. This feature directly impacts the company's ability to meet international compliance requirements.



Incorrect Answers:

Secure Remote Connections. While secure remote access is important for data security and protecting against unauthorized access, it is not a primary compliance feature. Secure connections help prevent data breaches but do not address requirements around where data is stored or processed, which are critical in global data protection laws.

High Granularity of Sensitive Information. Granularity in managing sensitive information is beneficial for defining access controls and managing data permissions, but it doesn’t directly impact compliance with international data localization laws. High granularity can improve security, but it’s not a substitute for data localization options.

Data Availability. Data availability ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed, which is important for business continuity. However, it’s not a feature that addresses regulatory requirements regarding data storage and handling based on geographic location, which is critical for compliance.

This is an outcome-based metric, not just an activity or participation measure.

Wrong Answers:

(B) Determine the number of employees who achieved a score higher than 80% on the training assessments and divide this by the total number of employees who participated in the training.

This measures knowledge retention at test time, not whether employees actually change their behavior.

Employees may memorize answers but still click phishing links in real life.

It’s useful for evaluating learning quality, but not sufficient for measuring overall program effectiveness.

(C) Calculate the number of employees who successfully completed the training program and divide this by the total number of employees eligible for the training.

This is a completion/participation metric, not an effectiveness metric.

Just because employees completed the training doesn’t mean it improved security behavior or reduced incidents.

This only proves compliance with HR requirements.

(D) Analyze the number of security incidents reported in your organization after the training program was implemented and compare this with the average incident rates from similar companies in the industry.

Benchmarking against industry is useful for context, but it doesn’t measure the effectiveness of your specific training program.

Differences could be due to company size, industry maturity, or different threat profiles.

It’s not a direct measure of your program’s success.

20. **In response to increased regulatory scrutiny, a financial services company’s risk management team has been assigned to create a comprehensive report detailing the security posture of its cloud-based infrastructure. The goal is to demonstrate compliance with stringent industry regulations and provide assurance to regulatory authorities that the organization’s cloud security measures are sufficient. Which element of the report would be the most crucial in meeting these regulatory expectations?**

(A) Detailed documentation and evidence of consistent security assessments, including regular compliance audits and vulnerability tests conducted on cloud environments.

(B) An in-depth analysis comparing the organization’s cloud security policies and controls to widely accepted industry benchmarks and best practices.

(C) A summary of the security certifications and standards upheld by the cloud service provider and its vendors, showcasing third-party validation of their security framework.

(D) The results of a previous Risk Assessment based on the NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework).

  **Correct Answer: (D) Data localization options**

Detailed documentation and evidence of consistent security assessments, including regular compliance audits and vulnerability tests conducted on cloud environments is the best choice because regulatory bodies generally expect proof of ongoing due diligence, including regular security assessments and compliance audits. Consistent documentation demonstrates that the company is actively managing its cloud security risks over time. Regular assessments, audits, and vulnerability testing provide a comprehensive view of the cloud environment’s security, supporting compliance with industry-specific regulations. Without these verifiable activities, the company would have difficulty proving its commitment to maintaining a secure cloud environment.

Wrong Answers:

An in-depth analysis comparing the organization’s cloud security policies and controls to widely accepted industry benchmarks and best practices. While comparing controls to industry benchmarks is valuable, it does not offer sufficient proof of ongoing compliance for regulators. A comparison to benchmarks is typically a one-time activity and may not reflect the cloud infrastructure's current security posture. Regulatory authorities expect organizations to demonstrate active, continuous efforts rather than a static comparison.

A summary of the security certifications and standards upheld by the cloud service provider and its vendors, showcasing third-party validation of their security framework. Security certifications, while important, are not a substitute for the organization's own efforts to secure its data. Relying on the cloud provider’s certifications alone could result in gaps in the risk management framework, as the organization remains responsible for overseeing security controls specific to its use of the cloud environment.

The results of a previous Risk Assessment based on the NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework).Previous risk assessments are part of risk management, but regulators expect recent evidence of active compliance efforts. While NIST RMF risk assessments are valuable, without regular updates, they don’t address the cloud environment's current security status or emerging threats.
