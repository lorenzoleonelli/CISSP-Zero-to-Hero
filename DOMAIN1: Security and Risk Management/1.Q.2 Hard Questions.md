1. **During the Risk Assessment process, having compiled an inventory of all your assets, you now seek to assess their vulnerabilities. What factors should be considered in this evaluation? (Choose all that apply)**

(A) Only the asset owners should provide a list of applicable risks

(B) Every asset has one or more vulnerabilities

(C) Most valuable asset should be analyzed first

(D) If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B,C,D)**

When assessing vulnerabilities during the Risk Assessment process, it is crucial to consider all relevant factors, including the nature of each asset, potential vulnerabilities associated with them, and prioritization based on value. Risk is sometimes schematized as threat x vulnerability, so we can approximate that If there aren't threats exploiting the vulnerability there is no risk.
It is not only the asset owners theat should provide a list of applicable risks.

4. **A countermeasure is a defensive action or tactic taken to mitigate or neutralize a threat or risk. What countermeasure listed below is the most efficient in preventing eavesdropping?**

(A) A shredder

(B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur

(C) Data hashing

(D) Cryptography

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (B) A policy that restricts the locations where confidential discussions can occur**

Limiting the places where sensitive conversations can take place reduces the likelihood of eavesdropping, as it minimizes opportunities for unauthorized individuals to overhear confidential information.

Wrong Answers:

- A shredder. While shredding documents can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information, it does not directly prevent eavesdropping, which involves secretly listening to conversations or communications.

- Data hashing. Data hashing is a cryptographic technique used to ensure data integrity by generating a fixed-size string of characters from input data. While hashing is an important security measure, it is not specifically designed to prevent eavesdropping.

- Cryptography. Cryptography involves securing communication by encoding messages to prevent unauthorized access or modification. While cryptography is crucial for protecting data during transmission, it does not directly address the issue of eavesdropping, which involves listening to conversations or communications without authorization.

(A) Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(B) Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack

(C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack

(D) Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) Power outage, Hardware Failure, DOS attack**

Power outages and hardware failures directly impact the availability of systems or services by causing them to become unavailable. Additionally, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks deliberately target the availability of services by overwhelming them with excessive traffic or requests, thereby rendering them inaccessible.
Wrong Answers:
Power outage, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: While power outages and hardware failures affect availability, a replay attack typically does not directly impact availability but rather focuses on compromising data integrity or confidentiality.
Dumpster Diving, Hardware Failure, Replay attack: Dumpster diving and replay attacks are not typically associated with reducing availability. Dumpster diving involves searching through discarded materials for sensitive information, which does not directly affect system availability. Replay attacks aim to manipulate data integrity or confidentiality rather than availability.
Dumpster Diving, Eavesdropping, DOS attack: Dumpster diving and eavesdropping primarily pose risks to data confidentiality rather than availability. While a DOS attack directly targets availability, eavesdropping and dumpster diving are more focused on accessing sensitive information.

6. **What will be the increase in ALE (Annualized Loss of Expectancy) of an hurricane damaging your server room if the EF (Exposure Factor) increases by 10% and AV (Asset Value) and ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) remains unchanged ?**

(A) 1%

(B) 20%

(C) 10%

(D) Not enough data provided

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

  **Correct Answer: (C) 10%**

In the process of risk ranking, quantitative analysis involves determining the anticipated annual cost of risk to the organization, known as the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE). This can be computed using the formula:

ALE = SLE (AV x EF) x ARO

ALE =  (AV x EF) x ARO

Here, the acronyms correspond to:

AV: Asset Value - The estimated financial worth or value of an asset within an organization.

EF: Exposure Factor - The percentage of asset value likely to be lost in the event of a security breach.

SLE: Single Loss Expectancy - The anticipated monetary loss from a single occurrence of a security incident.

ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence - The estimated frequency or likelihood of a security incident occurring within a year.

ALE: Annualized Loss Expectancy - The projected annual financial impact resulting from potential security incidents, calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO.
