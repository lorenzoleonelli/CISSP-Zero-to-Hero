   **Correct Answer: (C)**

When ISC² receives a complaint lodged against a member, the first action is the Initial review. During this phase, the Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee assesses whether the complaint meets the basic submission criteria—such as being in writing, specifying which Ethical Canon is involved, and providing sufficient evidence. This review determines whether the complaint can move forward into a full investigation or should be dismissed at the outset. This preliminary scrutiny ensures that only well-founded and documented allegations are pursued further

   **Correct Answer: (C)**

The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics, created by the Computer Ethics Institute in 1992, are a succinct set of principles designed to guide individuals toward responsible, respectful, and moral use of technology.
