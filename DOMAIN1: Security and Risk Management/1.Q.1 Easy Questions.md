2. **What is the first step ISC² takes when processing a complaint?**
   
(A) Deliver sanctions

(B) Notify all parties involved

(C) Initial review

(D) Inform the board

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (C)**

When ISC² receives a complaint lodged against a member, the first action is the Initial review. During this phase, the Professional Conduct (Ethics) Committee assesses whether the complaint meets the basic submission criteria—such as being in writing, specifying which Ethical Canon is involved, and providing sufficient evidence. This review determines whether the complaint can move forward into a full investigation or should be dismissed at the outset. This preliminary scrutiny ensures that only well-founded and documented allegations are pursued further

4. **Which of the following ensures that individuals cannot deny their actions or transactions?**
   
(A) Confidentiality

(B) Non‑repudiation

(C) Least‑privilege

(D) Cryptology

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (B)**

Non‑repudiation provides undeniable proof that a specific individual performed a given action or transaction. It typically uses mechanisms like digital signatures, encryption, secure audit logs, or timestamping to ensure that those actions cannot be later denied.

- Confidentiality protects data from unauthorized access, but doesn't prevent someone from denying their actions.

- Least‑privilege limits a user’s access rights to only what they need to do their job. It’s about damage control, not accountability.

- Cryptology is the use of encryption and cryptographic methods in general; it doesn’t, by itself, prevent denial of an action.

5. **Which of these is the opposite of availability?**
   
(A) Destruction

(B) Confidentiality

(C) Alteration

(D) Disclosure

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (A)**

In the CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability—the opposite of Availability is often referred to as Destruction or Denial. This means making data or systems inaccessible to authorized users, such as through system failures or denial-of-service attacks.

- Confidentiality is compromised by Disclosure (unauthorized access).

- Integrity is violated through Alteration (unauthorized modification).

- Disclosure directly opposes confidentiality, not availability.

6. **What is the final step in the IAAAframework ?**
   
(A) Alteration

(B) Authentication

(C) Authorization

(D) Accountability

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (D)**

The IAAA framework outlines a sequence of four critical steps for access management: Identification (who you are), Authentication (proving you are who you claim), Authorization (what you’re allowed to do), and finally Accountability (tracking and logging actions so they can be traced back to a specific identity)

Accountability, sometimes called auditing or accounting, ensures that every action taken by an authenticated and authorized user is recorded. This provides non‑repudiation and enables organizations to monitor for misuse or policy violations, closing the loop on the access control cycle.

7. **Which of the following represents the highest level of security in Identification according to NIST SP 800‑63 ?**

(A) AAL1

(B) NIS1

(C) IAL1

(D) IAL3

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (D)**

“IAL” stands for Identity Assurance Level, defined in NIST SP 800‑63A. It measures the confidence that a claimed digital identity actually belongs to the person asserting it.

IAL1 allows for self-asserted identities with no verification.

IAL2 requires proof of identity, either remotely or in person—like checking a driver's license or passport.

IAL3 is the highest level, mandating in-person or supervised remote verification with a trusted credential, including physical documents and biometrics confirmed by a trained representative

8. **What type of control is a firewall ?**

(A) Technical Control

(B) Administrative Control

(C) Physical Control

(D) Deterrent Control

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (A)**

A firewall is categorized as a technical (or logical) control because it's a hardware or software mechanism that enforces security by filtering and controlling network traffic based on configurable rules. It operates automatically to protect systems and data, rather than relying on policies, procedures, or physical barriers.

- Administrative controls involve policies, guidelines, and procedures.

- Physical controls involve tangible protections like locks, fences, or guards.

- Deterrent controls aim to discourage threats but don’t actively prevent or detect them—unlike a firewall.

9. **Which of the following plans covers the longest period of time ?**

(A) Tactical

(B) Strategic

(C) Operational

(D) Functional

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (B)**

A strategic plan sets the organization’s long-term direction—typically spanning 3 to 5 years or more—and defines vision, goals, and resource allocation. By contrast, tactical plans deal with medium-term objectives (usually 1–3 years) and translate strategy into actionable initiatives, while operational plans focus on short-term, day-to-day activities (weeks to a year) . Functional plans are generally similar in timeframe to tactical planning but are narrower, addressing individual departments or functions.

10. **You’ve decided that only the Access Control (AC) family of NIST SP 800‑53 applies to your organization. What have you just performed ?**

(A) Tailoring

(B) Merging

(C) Scoping

(D) Divestiture

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (C)**

By selecting only the AC control set and removing all others, you’re performing tailoring—which means adapting the NIST SP 800‑53 baseline to fit your organization’s specific requirements. This process includes:

- Applying scoping rules (eliminating irrelevant controls)

- Defining parameters

- Adding compensating controls if needed

This is exactly what NIST defines as tailoring: modifying a control baseline for your environment

11. **Which SOC report focuses on financial controls ?**

(A) SOC 3

(B) SOC 2 Type 1

(C) SOC 2

(D) SOC 1

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (D)**

A SOC 1 report is specifically designed to assess internal controls related to financial reporting, ensuring service organizations have effective procedures around client financial data 

SOC 2 and SOC 3 focus on data security, availability, confidentiality, integrity, and privacy—their scope centers on protecting customer data, not financial statements 

While SOC 2 Type 1 is a variant of SOC 2, it also does not cover financial controls—it assesses security controls at a point in time, not accounting processes.

12. **Reducing waste is an example of what ?**

(A) Process enhancement

(B) Risk transfer

(C) Risk avoidance

(D) Business enablement

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (A)**

When organizations reduce waste, they are improving efficiency and streamlining workflows—key goals of process enhancement (also known as process improvement or optimization). This approach focuses on eliminating unnecessary steps, saving time and resources, and enhancing overall performance. It’s distinct from risk-related strategies: risk avoidance is about steering clear of hazards, while risk transfer passes risk to another party, and business enablement refers to enabling business objectives through technology or processes.

13. **Who is responsible for reviewing and verifying the implementation of security policies and technical controls ?**

(A) Custodian

(B) Auditor

(C) Data Owner

(D) CISO

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (B)**

An auditor, whether internal or external, is tasked with examining whether an organization’s security policies and controls are implemented correctly and effectively. They validate compliance, assess control adequacy, identify gaps, and provide documented findings and recommendations.

- A Data Custodian implements and maintains technical controls under the direction of data owners but does not independently verify policy adherence.

- A Data Owner defines goals and requirements for data protection and access policies, but verification of implementation isn’t their primary responsibility.

- The CISO oversees the security strategy and policy creation, but auditors conduct the formal validation and reporting process.

14. **Which of the following provides the code of practice for information security controls and serves as implementation guidance for ISO 27001 controls ?**

(A) ISO 27002

(B) ISO 27001 Part 2

(C) NIST

(D) NIS2

<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (A)**

ISO 27002 is the official code of practice that offers detailed guidance and best practices for implementing the security controls specified in Annex A of ISO 27001. It provides control objectives, implementation advice, and management guidance to help organizations properly apply those controls.

- ISO 27001 Part 2 is not a recognized document; the main specification is simply ISO 27001.

- NIST refers to a family of U.S. standards (like NIST SP 800‑53), not ISO guidance.

- NIS2 is a European cybersecurity directive, not a code of practice for ISO controls.

32. **Which of the following correctly defines Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)?**

(A) EF × ARO

(B) AV × ARO

(C) (AV × EF)

(D) (AV × EF) × ARO

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

   **Correct Answer: (D) (AV × EF) × ARO**
   
ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy) estimates the potential yearly loss due to a specific threat. It's calculated using:

AV (Asset Value)

EF (Exposure Factor)

ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)

So the formula is: ALE = (AV × EF) × ARO
