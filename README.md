### "Don't just study hard. Study the way the exam thinks."

## 🎯 The Mission
The CISSP is not a technical vocabulary test; it is an evaluation of your ability to manage risk. **Zero to Hero** is a living curriculum designed to transition professionals from a technical "fixer" role to a strategic security leader. 

* **Theory to Application:** Bridging the gap between book knowledge and real-world scenarios.
* **Cognitive Mapping:** High-retention Mermaid diagrams for complex logic.
* **The Managerial Filter:** Nuanced guidance to identify the "Best" answer, not just the "Correct" one.
