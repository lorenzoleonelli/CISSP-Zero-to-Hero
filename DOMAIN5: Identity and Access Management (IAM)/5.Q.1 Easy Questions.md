## Easy Questions ##

1. In which of the following steps of Access Control do you usually apply the principles of "need to know" and "least privilege"?

A. Delivery
B. Authentication
C. Authorization
D. Accountability

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C. Authorization
The principles of need to know and least privilege are applied during the authorization step of access control. Authorization determines what an authenticated user can access. These principles ensure users only have the access necessary for their duties and nothing more.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Delivery: Not a recognized phase in access control.

B. Authentication: Verifies identity but doesn’t define permissions.

D. Accountability: Focuses on tracking and auditing actions, not assigning privileges.

2. There are circulating rumors within your company suggesting that an employee may be selling confidential data to competitors. You need to report this to Legal and Compliance. How would you define the potential risk and propose a suitable security measure?

A. Risk of Data Confidentiality, Improve Authentication
B. Risk of Data Loss, Check User Activity Log
C. Risk of Data Loss, Implement Access Control
D. Risk of Data Integrity, Implement Access Control

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. Risk of Data Loss, Check User Activity Log
The main concern is data loss, as confidential data could leave the company. Reviewing user activity logs helps detect unauthorized actions and provides evidence for investigation.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Focuses on confidentiality but ignores potential exfiltration.

C. Access control may not help if the employee already has legitimate access.

D. The issue is data loss, not data integrity (modification).

3. CAPTCHA prevents bots from accessing websites by challenging them with tasks easy for humans but hard for machines. To what type of authentication does CAPTCHA belong?

A. Challenge-Response Authentication
B. Symmetric Authentication
C. Behavioral Authentication
D. Biometric Authentication

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Challenge-Response Authentication
CAPTCHA is a challenge-response mechanism, requiring users to prove they’re human by solving a task.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Symmetric authentication is not a standard concept.

C. Behavioral authentication tracks user habits.

D. Biometric authentication uses physical traits, not puzzles.

4. Which of the following best describes the step in which a subject claims to have a specific identity?

A. Identification
B. Accountability
C. Authorization
D. Usernaming

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

5. Which of the following attacks typically catch passwords faster than others?

A. Brute Force Attack
B. Dictionary Attack
C. Rainbow Table Attack
D. Guess Attack

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C. Rainbow Table Attack

Rainbow tables use precomputed hash values, allowing attackers to find passwords quickly without recomputation.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Brute force tries every combination — very slow.

B. Dictionary attacks rely on common words.

D. Guess attacks depend on user-specific knowledge.

6. You need to develop a system for centrally authenticating company devices using digital certificates over TCP with open standards. What should you implement?

A. Analyze Firewall Characteristics
B. TACACS+
C. Diameter
D. RADIUS

✅ Correct Answer: C. Diameter

Diameter is an open, TCP-based protocol that improves upon RADIUS. It supports mobile and certificate-based authentication with stronger reliability and security.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Firewall analysis doesn’t address authentication needs.

B. TACACS+ is mainly for device admin access, not end-user authentication.

D. RADIUS uses UDP, not TCP, and is less secure in this context.

7. Which of the following hashing techniques is considered the most secure for password storage?

A. MD5
B. SHA-256
C. SHA-512
D. Argon2

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. Argon2

Argon2 is memory-hard, resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks, and adaptive — making it ideal for secure password hashing.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. MD5 is obsolete and vulnerable to collisions.

B. & C. SHA algorithms are fast but not memory-hard, making them easier to brute-force.

8. When designing usernames, which of the following should be avoided?

A. Usernames contain part of the user's surname
B. Usernames contain part of the user's name
C. Usernames are unique
D. Usernames describe the user's role

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. Usernames describe the user's role

9. You need to implement an access control system based on users’ positions that allows quick revocation when job roles change. Which model should you choose?

A. Role-Based Access Control
B. Role-Based Logging
C. Rule-Based Access Control
D. Attribute-Based Access Control

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC ties permissions to roles, not individuals, allowing fast updates when staff move or leave.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Not an access model, just a logging type.

C. Rule-based focuses on system-defined conditions.

D. ABAC uses dynamic attributes and is more complex to manage.

10. What is the declarative access control policy language implemented in XML with a model for interpreting security policies?

A. OAuth
B. XACML
C. SHTML
D. SPML

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. XACML
XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) defines and evaluates access control rules and decisions using XML.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. OAuth is an authorization framework, not a policy language.

C. SHTML relates to web includes, not access control.

D. SPML deals with provisioning, not policy definition.
