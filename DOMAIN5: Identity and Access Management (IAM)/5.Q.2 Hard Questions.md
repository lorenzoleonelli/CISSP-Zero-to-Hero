## Hard Questions ##

1. What may occur if an attacker successfully executes a race condition attack against an Identification and Access Management System?

A. Authentication happens before Identification
B. Authorization is skipped: after Identification the subject has full access
C. Accountability step is skipped
D. Authorization happens before accountability

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. Authorization is skipped: after Identification the subject has full access

A race condition attack manipulates the order of operations in an IAM system. If exploited, it can cause authorization to be skipped, granting unauthorized access right after identification. This happens when authentication and authorization processes are not properly synchronized, allowing attackers to slip through before verification completes.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Authentication always follows identification; this order is fixed.

C. Accountability logs may still record the action, even if unauthorized.

D. Authorization and accountability are distinct steps; reversing them isn’t the issue here.

2. A session in information security refers to the period of time during which a user interacts with a system or network, typically initiated upon successful authentication and terminated upon logout or expiration.
What should every session have?

A. Identification
B. Timeout
C. Controls to detect anomalous activity
D. All of them

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. All of them

A secure session must include identification, timeout, and anomaly detection controls. Identification ensures the user is known, timeout ends inactive sessions to reduce hijacking risks, and monitoring detects unusual behaviors during active sessions.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. Identification alone doesn’t maintain session integrity.

B. Timeout without monitoring still allows attacks during active use.

C. Anomaly detection is critical but incomplete without authentication controls.

3. Accountability ensures all actions in a system can be traced to their source. Which of the following activities is not associated with accountability?

A. Counting the number of identifications per day
B. Logging activities
C. Logging authentications
D. Logging privileged accesses

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Counting the number of identifications per day

Counting identifications only provides aggregate statistics. Accountability focuses on traceability — knowing who did what and when. It relies on detailed logs of authentications, activities, and privileged operations.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Activity logs are central to accountability.

C. Authentication logs provide evidence of access attempts.

D. Privileged access logging ensures oversight of admin actions.

4. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) combines multiple types of credentials. Which of the following combinations of authentication factors is the least secure?

A. Password + PIN
B. Fingerprint + Password
C. Retina + Smartcard
D. Fingerprint + PIN

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Password + PIN

Both are “something you know.” Using two knowledge-based factors provides minimal additional protection. If one is compromised, the other is likely vulnerable too.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Combines “something you are” and “something you know” — stronger.

C. Combines “something you have” and “something you are” — very strong.

D. Combines biometric and knowledge — also strong.

5. A frequent traveler must be prevented from accessing company systems from specific airports. What type of authentication factor can enforce this control?

A. Someone you know
B. Somewhere you are
C. Something you know
D. Something you have

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. Somewhere you are

“Somewhere you are” uses geolocation-based authentication, verifying login attempts from allowed locations. Restricting logins from specific airports is a perfect example of this factor in use.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

A. “Someone you know” is rarely used and not location-based.

C. “Something you know” (passwords) doesn’t restrict location.

D. “Something you have” (token or device) doesn’t enforce geo limits.

6. Identity management (IdM) is the structured process of handling digital identities. Which of the following best represents the lifecycle steps of Identity Management?

A. Identity creation, storage, revoking identities
B. Identification, authentication, authorization
C. Physical and logical identities management
D. Single factor authentication, multifactor authentication

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Identity creation, storage, revoking identities

The identity lifecycle includes creation (onboarding), maintenance (storage), and revocation (offboarding). These ensure proper access control throughout employment or system use.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Describes access control steps, not identity lifecycle.

C. Refers to scope, not lifecycle stages.

D. Refers to authentication methods, not identity processes.

7. Your organization welcomes a new security analyst. What is the first step in the identity proofing process?

A. Uniquely identify the individual within a specific population or context
B. Register biometric data in the system
C. Validate the connection between asserted identity and the real person
D. Assess authenticity and correlate data with the individual

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Uniquely identify the individual within a specific population or context

The first step in identity proofing is resolving the person’s identity — ensuring the individual is distinct and identifiable before validation or verification begins.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Biometric registration comes after identification.

C. & D. Validation steps occur only after the identity has been uniquely established.

8. Which commands do Windows and Linux use for Just-In-Time access control?

A. runas and sudo
B. run and cd-
C. runas and apt-get install admin
D. privilege escalation and accountability

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. runas and sudo

Both runas (Windows) and sudo (Linux) temporarily elevate privileges for specific commands — a form of Just-In-Time (JIT) access, which minimizes exposure by granting admin rights only when required.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Generic commands unrelated to privilege management.

C. apt-get install admin is invalid syntax.

D. Describes concepts, not specific commands.

9. Which of the following is not usually an advantage of a passwordless authentication system?

A. Faster Identification
B. Improved user experience
C. Faster authentication
D. Reduction of phishing attacks

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Faster Identification

Passwordless systems improve authentication, not identification. Users still need to identify themselves (e.g., with email or username) before authentication occurs.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. Removes password fatigue — better UX.

C. Eliminates password entry — faster authentication.

D. Mitigates phishing — no passwords to steal.

10. Which of the following best describes a service account?

A. It is used by applications or services, must have specific permissions and access rights
B. It is used by applications or services, could have specific permissions and access rights
C. It is used by humans for System Administration
D. It is used by humans for some services, must have specific permissions and access rights

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. It is used by applications or services, must have specific permissions and access rights

Service accounts are non-human accounts created for applications, services, or automated tasks. They require carefully scoped permissions to limit their power and follow the least privilege principle.

❌ Incorrect Answers:

B. “Could” implies optional permissions — inaccurate.

C. & D. Service accounts are never used by humans.
