## 5.3.0 Preface ##

IDaaS is the cloud-based extension of Identity and Access Management (IAM) that allows organizations to manage user authentication, authorization, and access control across internal and external systems. Instead of maintaining complex identity infrastructure in-house, companies can outsource identity management to a third-party provider, enabling seamless access to cloud applications, partner networks, and on-premise resources.

At its core, IDaaS simplifies identity management by integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and federated access protocols like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. This is especially useful for companies embracing hybrid cloud environments, where employees, contractors, and business partners need secure, scalable, and centralized access to multiple systems.

However, using a third-party IDaaS provider comes with inherent risks. Availability concerns arise if the provider experiences downtime, making authentication impossible. Loss of control is another challenge—outsourcing identity management means trusting an external provider with sensitive user data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). A data breach at the IDaaS provider could expose all user credentials linked to the organization.

:necktie: Adopting IDaaS is a trade-off between operational convenience and risk management. On one hand, it reduces the complexity of identity administration and ensures strong security controls (often exceeding what an organization can achieve internally). On the other hand, it introduces a single point of failure and requires strict third-party risk assessment, contract negotiation, and compliance verification to ensure proper security controls are in place.

:necktie: As a security pro you should recognize how identity is the foundation of access control and ensuring that when outsourcing identity services, availability, security, and compliance remain top priorities.

## 5.3.1 On-premise ##

On-premises (or on-prem) refers to identity and access management (IAM) systems that are hosted within an organization’s own infrastructure, like Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. These systems run inside the company’s offices or data centers, giving organizations full control over their security, configurations, and hardware.

The biggest advantage of on-prem IAM is total control—organizations can decide how authentication and access policies work without relying on a third party. However, this control comes at a cost: higher maintenance efforts, requiring dedicated staff to manage, secure, and update the system.

One of the biggest challenges with on-prem IAM is integration. Many legacy systems were not built to connect with modern cloud-based applications or support federated identity with external partners. This limitation forces organizations to invest in additional tools like SAML gateways, SSO providers, or IAM extensions to bridge the gap between on-prem and cloud environments.

For security professionals, the trade-off is clear: on-prem solutions offer more control and security oversight but require more effort and expertise to maintain. Organizations need to balance security, cost, and flexibility when deciding whether to keep IAM on-prem or migrate to cloud-based identity services.

:bulb: A Microsoft Domain Controller (DC) is a server that manages security authentication requests in a Microsoft Active Directory environment. It is responsible for verifying user credentials, managing access permissions, and enforcing security policies for all computers and devices within the domain. The Domain Controller stores and manages critical data, such as user accounts, group memberships, and permissions, ensuring centralized management of network resources.

:bulb: In Linux, the equivalent of a Windows Domain Controller is typically a Directory Server that uses LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Kerberos for authentication and authorization. A popular implementation is Samba, which can act as a domain controller for Linux-based systems, allowing them to integrate with Active Directory environments. Samba can authenticate users, manage access controls, and handle network resources in a similar way to a Windows Domain Controller, but in a Linux ecosystem.

## 5.3.2 Cloud ##

Some companies are born in the cloud and never use traditional on-prem infrastructure. Others, often older organizations, move to the cloud to cut costs and simplify IT management. In both cases, maintaining legacy IAM systems (which require expensive hardware, software, and specialized IT staff) makes little sense. Instead, Identity as a Service (IDaaS) provides a more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution.
IDaaS acts as a central identity hub, managing user authentication and access to cloud-based applications and federating identities across different platforms, services, or even partner organizations. For businesses transitioning to the cloud but still relying on some legacy systems, hybrid IDaaS can bridge the gap—extending IAM capabilities to both on-prem and cloud environments.

One of the biggest advantages of cloud IDaaS is its ability to automate user provisioning. Many SaaS applications integrate directly with IDaaS, allowing for Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning. This means a user’s account is created automatically when they first attempt to log in, provided they have the right permissions. This reduces administrative overhead, eliminates manual setup delays, and ensures that access is granted securely and efficiently.

1. Why are many organizations moving away from traditional on-prem IAM systems?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Traditional on-prem IAM requires costly hardware, complex software, and specialized IT staff to maintain. For companies born in the cloud—or older organizations seeking cost reduction and simplicity—maintaining such legacy systems no longer makes sense. Cloud-based alternatives like IDaaS provide scalability, efficiency, and lower operational costs. </details>

## 5.3.3 Hybrid ##

Hybrid IDaaS is like having one foot in the cloud and the other still on the ground. It’s a mix of traditional on-premise identity management and modern cloud-based identity solutions. This setup is useful for companies that still rely on legacy systems but are gradually moving to the cloud. A common example is an organization using Microsoft Active Directory (AD) for internal applications while also adopting Azure AD, Microsoft’s cloud-based identity service. Both systems work together, synchronizing user credentials and access rights, allowing a smooth transition over time.

Even if a full migration to the cloud isn’t the goal, hybrid IDaaS helps bridge the gap. On-premise IAM systems continue to manage older applications, while cloud-based IDaaS handles authentication for web-based services and external partners. This setup simplifies user experience by allowing single sign-on (SSO), so employees don’t have to juggle multiple logins.

However, managing a hybrid identity system comes with challenges. Organizations need to maintain both environments, ensuring security, updates, and proper synchronization between systems. There’s also an inherent risk—if the cloud provider managing identities is compromised, attackers could potentially gain access to on-premise resources as well. That’s why careful planning, proper security controls, and regular monitoring are essential when adopting a hybrid IDaaS approach.
