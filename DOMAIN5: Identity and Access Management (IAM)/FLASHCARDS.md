6. The definition of password spraying.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A type of brute-force attack where attackers try common passwords across many accounts to avoid detection. </details>

7. What credential stuffing is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An attack where stolen username-password combinations are used to gain unauthorized access to multiple accounts. </details>

8. The main security concern with shared accounts.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Lack of accountability since multiple users access the same credentials, making auditing difficult. </details>

9. The role of an Identity Broker.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A service that facilitates identity verification and authentication between multiple providers and relying parties. </details>

10. What an access recertification process ensures.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A periodic review of user permissions to ensure access remains appropriate based on roles and business needs. </details>

11. What directory synchronization in IAM is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The process of ensuring consistency between an on-premise and cloud-based identity store. </details>

12. The meaning of identity proofing.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The process of verifying that a personâ€™s claimed identity is legitimate before granting access. </details>

13. How a session timeout improves security.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> It automatically logs users out after a period of inactivity, preventing unauthorized access. </details>

14. What an identity repository is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A database or directory that stores user identities, attributes, and authentication data. </details>

15. The main purpose of Role Mining in IAM.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Analyzing user access patterns to identify appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) policies. </details>

16. The principle of Identity Federation.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> It allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services across different organizations using the same identity. </details>

17. What a privileged identity is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A user or system account with elevated permissions that require strict monitoring and security controls. </details>

18. What an orphan account is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An account that remains active after its associated user has left the organization. </details>

19. What attribute release control in federated systems does.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The process of managing which user attributes are shared with third-party services. </details>

20. What a shadow account represents.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An undocumented or unauthorized account that may pose security risks. </details>

21. The definition of entitlement creep.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The gradual accumulation of unnecessary privileges over time, increasing security risks. </details>

22. How a bastion host enhances security in access control.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> It acts as a hardened, controlled access point between secure and untrusted networks. </details>

23. The purpose of an identity risk assessment.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Evaluating identity-related threats and vulnerabilities to improve access controls. </details>

24. What self-sovereign identity (SSI) is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A decentralized identity model where users control their credentials without relying on a central authority. </details>

25. The definition of risk-based authentication (RBA).

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An adaptive authentication method that considers user behavior, location, and device risk before granting access. </details>

26. The meaning of an Identity Governance framework.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Policies and processes that ensure proper management of digital identities and access controls. </details>

27. What Single Log-Out (SLO) does.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A feature that logs users out of all linked applications when they sign out of one. </details>

28. What an access entitlement review is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A security audit to verify that users have appropriate access rights. </details>

29. The meaning of user provisioning in IAM.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The process of creating user accounts and access rights. </details>

30. What deprovisioning is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The process of revoking user access when they leave an organization or change roles. </details>

31. The concept of time-based access control.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A security mechanism that grants or restricts access based on predefined time periods. </details>

32. The definition of biometric authentication.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A method of verifying identity based on unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition. </details>

33. What an identity assurance level (IAL) represents.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A measure of confidence in the claimed identity of a user, often used in authentication frameworks like NIST 800-63. </details>

34. The concept of step-down authentication.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A mechanism that reduces user privileges after authentication, limiting access to sensitive resources unless re-authenticated. </details>

35. The meaning of delegated authentication.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A process where one system or service relies on another trusted system to authenticate users. </details>

36. What Just Enough Administration (JEA) is.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A security principle that grants users only the minimum privileges needed for a specific task, reducing attack surfaces. </details>

37. The concept of policy-based access control (PBAC).

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> An access control model where permissions are granted based on dynamic policies rather than static roles or attributes. </details>

38. The meaning of a trust framework in IAM.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A set of agreed-upon standards and policies that enable interoperability between different identity providers and relying parties. </details>

39. What an adaptive access control system does.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A security mechanism that dynamically adjusts access permissions based on real-time risk assessments. </details>

40. The concept of zero trust identity management.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A security model where no user or system is trusted by default, requiring continuous verification of identity and access permissions. </details>
