## 5.0 Preface ##

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is mandatory for keeping information safe. It consists in controlling who can access company assets, and to do that, you need to know who is trying to get access and verify that they’re allowed to. Whether it’s a user, system, application, or process, IAM helps manage access by focusing on four main areas: Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability (IAAA).

To break it down simply:
- **Identification:** Figuring out who or what is requesting access (like logging into your computer).
- **Authentication:** Verifying that the person or system is who they claim they are (like entering a password or using a fingerprint).
- **Authorization:** Deciding what they’re allowed to do once they’ve been authenticated (like accessing files or apps).
- **Accountability:** Keeping track of what they did (like logging their activities for auditing).
