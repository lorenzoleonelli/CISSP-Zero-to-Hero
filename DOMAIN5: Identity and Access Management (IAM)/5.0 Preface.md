## 5.0 Preface ##

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is mandatory for keeping information safe. It consists in controlling who can access company assets, and to do that, you need to know who is trying to get access and verify that they’re allowed to. Whether it’s a user, system, application, or process, IAM helps manage access by focusing on four main areas: Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability (IAAA).

To break it down simply:
- **Identification:** Figuring out who or what is requesting access (like logging into your computer).
- **Authentication:** Verifying that the person or system is who they claim they are (like entering a password or using a fingerprint).
- **Authorization:** Deciding what they’re allowed to do once they’ve been authenticated (like accessing files or apps).
- **Accountability:** Keeping track of what they did (like logging their activities for auditing).

The first step in IAM processes starts by creating user identities and giving them credentials (passwords, badges, PIN numbers, mobile phones, etc.). When users need access, they must present these credentials to be checked. Over time, these credentials need to be reviewed and updated, and eventually, they’re retired when no longer needed. This process is called **provisioning** (creating access) and **deprovisioning** (removing access), and it's part of the overall credentials lifecycle management.

For example:
- **Provisioning:** When a new employee joins the company, you create her/his account and give him/her access to the systems she/he need.
- **Deprovisioning:** When the employee leaves, you deactivate her/his account to remove access and prevent unauthorized use.

This cycle keeps the organization secure by making sure only the right people or systems can access important information, and only for as long as they need it.

:bulb: **Deprovisioning vs Decommissioning.**
Deprovisioning involves revoking access rights and permissions from users or systems that no longer require them. This process ensures that former employees, contractors, or systems do not retain access to sensitive resources, thereby maintaining security and compliance.
Decommissioning, on the other hand, is the process of retiring and removing assets, such as hardware or software, from active service. This includes tasks like securely erasing data, uninstalling applications, and disposing of equipment. Decommissioning is a final step, indicating that the asset is no longer in use and has been permanently retired.

**Access management** means making sure users can only access the things they need, exactly when and where they need them—nothing more

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** plays a key role in almost every part of an organization’s security. As a security professional, it’s important to make sure the right processes and technology are in place to manage access securely. This means, in other words:
1. Understanding what identity information is needed (like usernames and passwords).
2. Selecting and setting up systems that handle this information properly.
3. Using administrative controls (like regular access reviews) to support the technology and ensure everything stays secure.

As many other aspects of Information Security, Access management requires a balance between security and usability. If security is too strict, it can make it difficult for users to access the systems they need. On the other hand, if security is too relaxed, it puts your system’s Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability at risk. Finding the right balance ensures that users can work efficiently without compromising security.

### Open Questions ###

1. What is the primary purpose of Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
IAM is designed to control who can access company assets and resources, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can interact with sensitive information. This helps protect the organization's Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability by verifying identities and granting permissions.
</details>

2. What are the four main areas of IAM, and what do they involve?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
The four main areas of IAM are Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability (IAAA). Identification determines who is requesting access, Authentication verifies their identity, Authorization defines what they can do once authenticated, and Accountability tracks and logs their actions for auditing purposes.
</details>

3. What happens during the Identification process in IAM?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
During Identification, the system needs to figure out who or what is trying to access the system, such as when a user logs into their computer or when an automated system requests access to a resource. It's the first step to determining if the access request is legitimate.
</details>

4. How does Authentication contribute to the IAM process?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Authentication ensures that the entity requesting access is indeed who they claim to be. This typically involves verifying credentials such as passwords, biometrics, or other authentication factors like smart cards or one-time passcodes.
</details>

5. What role does Authorization play in IAM, and how is it determined?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Authorization occurs after authentication and determines what the authenticated user or system is allowed to do within the environment. This could involve deciding which files, applications, or resources the entity can access and what actions they can perform.
</details>

6. What is Accountability in IAM, and why is it important?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Accountability refers to tracking and recording user activities within the system. This is crucial for auditing purposes, ensuring that any actions taken by users or systems can be traced and verified, helping detect potential security breaches or unauthorized access.
</details>

7. What is the difference between Provisioning and Deprovisioning in IAM?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Provisioning refers to the process of creating user identities and assigning necessary access permissions when they join the organization, while Deprovisioning involves removing access and disabling accounts when users leave the organization or no longer need access.
</details>

8. How does Decommissioning differ from Deprovisioning?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Decommissioning involves permanently retiring and removing assets, like hardware or software, from active use, including securely erasing data and disposing of equipment. Deprovisioning, on the other hand, focuses on revoking access rights without necessarily removing the asset itself.
</details>

9. Why is it important to find a balance between security and usability in IAM?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
A balance between security and usability is crucial to ensure that users can access the systems they need to perform their jobs effectively while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the organization's information. Too strict security can hinder productivity, while too lenient security poses risks to the system.
</details>

10. What are some administrative controls that support IAM and maintain security?
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Administrative controls in IAM include actions like regular access reviews, where user permissions are periodically evaluated to ensure they still align with their roles. These controls help maintain security by ensuring that only the necessary access is granted and that outdated or unnecessary permissions are removed.
