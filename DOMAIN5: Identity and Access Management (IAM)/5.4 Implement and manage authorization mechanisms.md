## 5.4.0 Preface ##

:necktie: The terms  permissions, rights, and privilegesare often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in access control:
- **Permissions** – These define what a user or system can do with a specific resource. Permissions are tied to objects (files, folders, databases) and specify actions like read, write, execute, delete, or modify. Example: A user has read and write permissions on a shared folder but cannot delete files.
- **Rights** – These are system-level actions that a user or process can perform, often tied to operating system functions rather than specific objects. Rights are assigned at a higher level, such as allowing a user to log in, change system settings, or install software. Example: A system administrator has the right to shut down a server.
- **Privileges** – These encompass both permissions and rights but are broader in scope. Privileges represent elevated access beyond a regular user, often requiring administrative control. Example: A database administrator has the privilege to manage user accounts and modify database structures.

With a “ physicval security” example:
- A software engineer (employee) has permission to enter their floor but cannot access the data center.
- A security guard has rights to lock/unlock floors but cannot enter the finance department.
- The CSO has privileges to change the security policies and determine who can access what.

Authorization isn’t just about granting access; it’s a continuous process that determines if a user or system has the right to interact with a resource. It happens at two key moments: first, when a user is onboarded into an identity and access management (IAM) system and assigned permissions, and second, at the moment of access, when the system verifies if the user still meets the necessary conditions. While this is manageable in small environments, organizations with hundreds or thousands of users accessing countless systems and data assets need structured access control models to keep things secure and efficient.

:link: [NIST SP 800-192 “Verification and Test Methods for Access Control Policies/Models”](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/192/final) underlines that Access control systems are among the most critical of computer security components. Faulty policies, misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementations can result in serious vulnerabilities. To formally and precisely capture the security properties that access control should adhere to, access control models are usually written, bridging the gap in abstraction between policies and mechanisms. 

Access control determines who can access what in an IT system. There are several approaches, each with different levels of flexibility and security. Here's a plain-text breakdown:

| Access Control Model | Who Decides | Description | Variants / Examples |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** | User | The owner of a file, system, or resource decides who can access it. Flexible but risky because users can grant access freely. | - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Grants access based on user attributes (e.g., department, device type).<br> - **Content-Based Access Control:** Permissions depend on the content of the resource (e.g., a document labeled "Confidential").<br> - **Rule-Based Access Control:** Uses predefined rules to allow or deny access (e.g., “Only HR can access payroll files”).<br> - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access is assigned based on a person’s job role (e.g., "Managers can approve expenses"). |
| **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** | System | The system, not users, defines access policies based on security labels. Used in high-security environments like government and military. | Example: A user with "Secret" clearance can read a Secret document but not a Top Secret one. |
| **Non-Discretionary Access Control** | Risk-Based & Adaptive | Access decisions depend on dynamic risk factors like user behavior, device security, and time of access. Often used in Zero Trust and modern cloud environments. | Examples: <br>- Blocking login from an unusual location.<br>- Denying access from outdated software.<br>- Restricting access during odd hours. |

Access control models help define and enforce who can do what within an IT environment. For example, a firewall might use rule-based access control (RBAC) to enforce traffic policies, while a file-sharing system might allow users to set their own permissions through discretionary access control (DAC). Meanwhile, a corporate HR system might assign permissions based on job roles using role-based access control (RBAC). Other models, like attribute-based access control (ABAC) and risk-based access control, take factors like device type, location, or login behavior into account to make dynamic access decisions.

:link: [NIST SP 800-207 “Zero Trust Architecture”](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final) explains how Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. 

:brain: DAC: Users have control but risk misconfigurations.
MAC: Strict, system-enforced security for classified data.
Non-DAC (Risk-Based): Access is dynamic and context-aware to enhance security.

Since no single model fits all situations, modern IT environments often blend multiple access control approaches.

The following concepts are often associated with authorization mechanisms:
- **Implicit Deny** means that unless access is explicitly granted, it is denied by default. This principle ensures that users or systems cannot access resources unless they have been specifically authorized. If no rule permits access, the system automatically blocks the request. This approach minimizes security risks by preventing unintended or unauthorized access.
- An **Access Control Matrix (ACM)** is a structured way to define and manage access rights within a system. It organizes users, resources, and permissions in a grid-like structure where each row represents a subject (such as a user or process), each column represents an object (such as a file or system), and the intersection defines the allowed actions (such as read, write, or execute). While ACMs provide a clear and detailed access control model, they can become impractical in large systems due to the complexity of managing a vast number of subjects and objects.
- A **Capability List* is an alternative way of managing access that focuses on what a specific subject can do rather than defining permissions per object. Each user or process holds a list of capabilities specifying which resources they can access and what actions they can perform. Unlike traditional access control lists (ACLs), where permissions are tied to resources, capability lists attach permissions directly to the user or process. This model enhances security by making it harder for unauthorized users to modify access rights, but it requires careful management to ensure capabilities are properly assigned and revoked.

### Open Questions ###

1. What is the difference between permissions, rights, and privileges in access control?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Permissions define what actions a user or system can perform on a specific resource (e.g., read, write, execute).  
Rights refer to system-level actions that a user or process can perform, such as logging in or changing system settings.  
Privileges encompass both permissions and rights, typically representing elevated access beyond regular users, often requiring administrative control.  
</details>

2. How do permissions, rights, and privileges relate to physical security in an organization?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Permissions could be compared to an employee’s ability to enter specific areas in a building (e.g., read-only access to a shared folder).  
Rights would be like a security guard’s ability to lock and unlock floors (system-level controls).  
Privileges represent broader authority, such as a CSO having the privilege to change security policies or determine access rules across the organization.  
</details>

3. How does authorization work in an identity and access management (IAM) system?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Authorization happens when a user is first onboarded to an IAM system, granting them initial permissions, and again during access attempts, where the system verifies if the user still meets the necessary conditions for access.

</details>

6. How does Discretionary Access Control (DAC) differ from Mandatory Access Control (MAC)?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a model where the owner of a resource decides who can access it. It’s flexible but risky as users can freely grant access.  
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is enforced by the system and determines access based on security labels, offering a more strict and controlled approach.  
</details>

7. What is Non-Discretionary Access Control and how is it used in modern security models like Zero Trust?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Non-Discretionary Access Control is context-aware and based on risk, such as user behavior, device security, or time-based conditions. It’s often used in Zero Trust environments where access is determined dynamically based on risk assessments.  
</details>

8. How do different access control models, such as DAC, MAC, and RBAC, define access to systems and resources?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
DAC allows users to control access to resources they own, making it more flexible but prone to errors.  
MAC is system-enforced, making it stricter, typically used for classified or highly secure data.  
RBAC assigns access based on roles, like "manager," which simplifies access management for large organizations.  
</details>

9. What does Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) assume about trust in systems and user accounts?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts, whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources.  
</details>

10. What are the key differences between an Access Control Matrix (ACM) and a Capability List?  
<details>
  <summary>Show answer</summary>
An Access Control Matrix (ACM) is a table that defines the relationship between users, resources, and permissions, detailing what actions each user can perform on each resource.  
A Capability List, on the other hand, is a list of permissions tied to a user or process, specifying which resources they can access and what actions they can take, offering a more user-centric approach.

## 5.4.1 Role-based access control (RBAC) ##

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is like assigning keys to employees based on their job titles rather than giving out individual permissions to every single person. Instead of deciding what each user can access one by one, the system groups users into roles, and those roles come with predefined permissions.
Think of it this way: In a company, a security analyst needs to review security logs and monitor threats, but they don’t need to install software on servers. Meanwhile, a system administrator needs to configure and maintain systems but shouldn’t be able to tamper with security logs. In an RBAC system, each of these job roles would be assigned access to only the tools and data they need—nothing more. This follows the principle of least privilege, meaning users get only the minimum access necessary to do their jobs.
RBAC also helps prevent conflicts of interest by avoiding dangerous role combinations. For example, if someone could both manage a system and delete security logs, they could cover their tracks after making unauthorized changes. A well-implemented RBAC system prevents this by ensuring that no single person has too much control.
Another big advantage is efficiency. Instead of manually granting access to every new hire or adjusting permissions every time someone changes teams, organizations can simply assign or remove roles. If all lawyers in a company need access to certain legal documents, it’s easier to create a "Legal Team" role with the correct permissions rather than managing each lawyer's access separately. This not only strengthens security but also saves time and administrative effort.

:bulb: Privilege creep happens when users accumulate more access rights over time than they actually need. This typically occurs when employees change roles or take on temporary responsibilities, but their old permissions are never revoked. Over time, they end up with excessive access, which increases security risks.
This is bad because it violates the principle of least privilege, making systems more vulnerable to insider threats, accidental data breaches, or unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises an overprivileged account, they gain broader access than necessary, worsening the potential damage.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps prevent privilege creep by assigning permissions based on roles rather than individuals. When a user switches positions, they are simply assigned a new role with appropriate access, and their old role (and its permissions) is removed. This structured approach ensures users only have the access they need at any given time, reducing security risks and simplifying management.

:bulb: In the Microsoft ecosystem through Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD, RBAC ensures users receive only the necessary access based on their job roles, simplifying permission management and enforcing least privilege across cloud and on-premises environments.

:necktie: Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) grants permissions based on specific tasks a user needs to perform, rather than their overall job role. It is similar to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) but TBAC is more dynamic, allowing access only when a specific task is active, enhancing security by limiting unnecessary permissions.

## 5.4.2 Rule based access control ##

Rule-Based Access Control operates on predefined rules that dictate who can access what based on specific conditions. Think of it like an exclusive event—if your name is on the guest list, you're in; if not, you're turned away.

In digital security, Rule-Based Access Control is commonly enforced through **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which specify who is permitted to interact with files, networks, or systems. Firewalls, for example, use rule sets to filter traffic, allowing or blocking connections based on IP addresses or ports. Similarly, file systems rely on ACLs to determine if a user can read, modify, or delete a file.

Rule-Based Access Control also defines access behavior through implicit and explicit permissions. Some systems follow an "implicit allow" approach, where access is granted unless a specific rule blocks it—like a store welcoming all customers except known shoplifters. In contrast, implicit deny takes a stricter stance: only users explicitly listed as authorized are allowed in, ensuring tighter security by default. This "deny all, allow by exception" model is a cybersecurity best practice, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

:bulb: You might see Role-Based Access Control abbreviated as RBAC or RoBAC, while Rule-Based Access Control can also be written as RBAC or RuBAC. This overlap in acronyms can be confusing, but don’t worry—no one will try to trick you with wordplay during your exam or in your professional career. What really matters is understanding the fundamental differences between these models and how they apply to real-world security.


## 5.4.3 Mandatory access control (MAC) ##

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a strict access control system often used in military and government settings, where permissions are determined by predefined security policies rather than individual discretion. Unlike more flexible models where users or administrators can grant access as needed, MAC enforces rigid classifications based on security labels assigned to both users (subjects) and data (objects).
Think of it like a security clearance system: if a document is labeled Top Secret, only users with Top Secret clearance can access it. A user with Secret clearance would be blocked, even if the document owner wanted to grant them access. This model ensures that sensitive information remains protected according to strict classification rules.
MAC is the foundation for models like Bell–LaPadula (which focuses on confidentiality) and Biba (which prioritizes data integrity). These models enforce strict rules about who can read or modify information based on security levels, preventing both unauthorized access and accidental corruption of important data.

:bulb: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is often referred to as a lattice-based model because it uses a hierarchy of security labels, creating a lattice structure where access is determined based on the relationship between these labels. The lattice model organizes data and users into different levels of security (e.g., Top Secret, Secret, Unclassified), and the access permissions are based on the position of these labels within the lattice. A user with a lower-level clearance (e.g., Secret) cannot access data classified at a higher level (e.g., Top Secret), but they may access data at their own level or lower. This structured approach forms the "lattice" of access rights.
MAC is considered prohibitive rather than permissive because, in this system, access is denied by default unless explicitly allowed by the security policy. In other words, the system is set up to restrict access and only permits it when the user’s clearance and the object’s classification align according to the predefined rules. For example, if a user does not have the appropriate clearance level for a specific document, access is denied, regardless of the user’s intention or the creator's permissions

## 5.4.4 Discretionary access control (DAC) ## 

In a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model, the decision to grant access to resources is left to the discretion of the data owner. For example, the owner of a file decides who can access it and what actions they can take, like reading or editing. This flexibility allows the owner to set broad access, such as allowing everyone to read a document, while reserving editing rights for a specific group of people. DAC is a decentralized model, often used when there isn’t a centralized authority with enough context to manage access decisions. 

Google is an example of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) because users who create content, such as documents or files in Google Drive, have the ability to decide who can access and modify that content. The content owner can choose whether to share it publicly, with specific people, or keep it private, giving them full control over access permissions.

However, DAC’s flexibility can also create security risks. Since many owners are making access decisions independently, it’s harder to enforce consistent security policies across the organization. Furthermore, since owners have the ability to change permissions at will, there’s a potential for abuse, especially if an insider with malicious intent misuses their access control privileges.

:bulb: To implement DAC, each object must have a single, designated owner.


## 5.4.5 Attribute-based access control (ABAC) ##

Attribute-based access control (ABAC or ABC), also known as policy-based access control, is an advanced access control model that uses a combination of attributes related to the subject to decide whether access should be granted. These attributes could include the user's role, identity, time of access, or even the location of the request. For instance, a policy may state that a data entry professional can only access systems during regular business hours, so if access is attempted outside of this window, it would be denied.

ABAC is more flexible than traditional models like Rule based Access Control because it allows for more dynamic and risk-based decisions. It can integrate factors like multi-factor authentication or restrict access based on where or when a request is made, offering a highly customizable access control mechanism. This makes it more suitable for environments that require detailed, context-based rules, such as ensuring access to sensitive data is limited to certain times or devices. For example, a system may allow access to a routine user from their usual workstation but deny access if the user attempts to log in from an unfamiliar device in a different country, protecting against potential security threats.

:link: In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Attribute-Based Control (ABAC) can be integrated to enforce network access decisions based on attributes such as user identity, location, or device type, enabling more granular and adaptive network security policies. Essentially, SDN provides the infrastructure, while ABAC defines the rules for controlling access to resources within that infrastructure.
