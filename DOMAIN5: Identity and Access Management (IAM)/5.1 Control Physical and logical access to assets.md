## 5.1 Control Physical and logical access to assets ##

Access control encompasses the systems and processes designed to safeguard an organization’s assets while ensuring that only authorized individuals have the appropriate level of access. Core principles of access control include:
1. **need-to-know:** restricts access to information or resources based strictly on a user’s necessity to perform their job. Users are only given access to the specific data or systems required to complete their tasks, minimizing exposure to unnecessary or sensitive information.
2. **least privilege:** ensures that users or systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their assigned duties. By limiting permissions, it reduces the potential damage caused by accidental misuse or unauthorized access.
3. **separation of duties:** involves dividing responsibilities and privileges among multiple individuals or systems to prevent conflicts of interest or the misuse of power. No single person should have enough access or control to carry out critical tasks independently, reducing the risk of fraud, errors, or abuse.

:necktie: These controls apply across all organizational levels and to all asset types (both physical and logical), ensuring comprehensive protection and regulated access.

Access control systems are designed to regulate who or what (referred to as **subjects**) can interact with specific assets (referred to as **objects**). These objects include data such as files and system resources like networks and computing power. In a physical context, access control involves securing facilities, like offices and server rooms, which are considered critical assets.

Subjects, which can be either human users or automated systems (e.g., devices or software processes), need access to these objects. Access control ensures that these interactions follow specific rules, determining who can read, write, or otherwise use a particular resource. For example, a user may be allowed to read a file but restricted from editing it, while a nonhuman entity like a system process may be permitted access based on the sensitivity of the data involved.

Physical security involves controlling entry into sensitive areas, such as server rooms. For instance, server rooms often employ cipher locks, whereas lower-priority objects like desktop computers may just have basic security measures like physical locks. These protections extend to servers, which house crucial organizational data and applications. Logical access controls, on the other hand, use technical measures—such as authentication and authorization—to regulate access to systems, networks, and sensitive information.

The ultimate goal of access control systems is to prevent the loss of the three core security attributes (CIA Triad):
- Confidentiality: Ensuring only authorized entities can access sensitive data.
- Integrity: Protecting systems and data from unauthorized alterations.
- Availability: Ensuring authorized users can access data and systems when needed.

Sometimes, two more principles are added to the CIA triad: Non-repudiation (ensuring actions can't be denied) and Authenticity (verifying that users and systems are genuine). This is called CIANA, which covers a broader range of security goals.

Access control is fundamentally about regulating interactions between entities (subjects) and resources (objects) within an environment that requires security. The goal is to mediate and enforce access permissions to ensure that only authorized subjects can interact with specific objects based on predefined policies and security requirements.
The following picture recaps some of the concepts above explained and the concepts of labeling and marking taken from Domain 2.

As a security professional you should recognize, assess and protect all the following assets:

**Information:** This is all the data the organization stores on servers, computers, and smaller devices. It can be simple files or large databases. Logical access controls prevent unauthorized access to this information.

**Systems:** These are IT systems that provide services, like a file server or a web server supporting e-commerce. Permissions manage access to these systems.

**Devices:** This includes routers, switches, servers, computers, tablets, smartphones, and printers. Even if employees use personal devices, any organizational data stored on them is still an asset.

**Facilities:** This refers to the physical locations owned or rented by the organization, like buildings or rooms. Physical security controls protect these spaces.

**Applications:** Applications offer access to data and services. Managing access to these with permissions adds another layer of security.

**Services:** These are the activities or functions provided by an organization’s systems, like email or cloud storage. Controlling access to services ensures they’re used properly and securely.


:bulb: In most operating systems, access control rules define the permissions or rights that a user (or subject) has over resources (objects) such as files, directories, or processes. These rules typically fall under various logical access modes that determine the level of interaction a subject can have with an object. The basic access modes are:
- Create: Allows a subject to create a new object (e.g., creating a new file).
- Update: Allows a subject to modify an existing object (e.g., editing a file).
- Read: Allows a subject to view the content of an object (e.g., reading a document).
- Read/Write: Allows both reading and modifying an object.
- Execute: Allows a subject to run or execute an object (e.g., running a program).
- Delete: Allows a subject to remove an object from the system (e.g., deleting a file).

In Windows-based systems, access control is implemented using Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs define which users or groups can perform specific actions on an object. Windows permissions are typically more granular, and permissions like Read, Write, Execute, and Delete can be explicitly set for different users or groups. Windows also allows setting permissions on a file or folder, including special permissions for various administrative tasks.

Unix and Linux systems use a simpler, more straightforward owner-group-other model for access control, where permissions are set for the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and others (everyone else). Each of these categories can be granted Read (r), Write (w), and Execute (x) permissions. Unix systems use a more numeric approach (e.g., 755) to represent permission settings. Additionally, sudo allows users to elevate their privileges temporarily, giving them higher levels of access based on predefined roles.

One major aspect of IAM implementation is the method of decision-making and enforcement:

- Centralized IAM: Involves a dedicated team and system overseeing all access control activities. This approach ensures rigorous oversight and monitoring but can introduce a single point of failure.
- Decentralized IAM: Distributes access control decisions to system or information owners, allowing for greater flexibility and freedom. However, this can lead to inconsistent enforcement and a lack of unified oversight.
- Hybrid IAM: Combines elements of both centralized and decentralized approaches. It allows certain access control decisions to be made centrally while giving system owners the freedom to manage specific areas. This approach aims to balance oversight with flexibility.

## 5.1.1 Information ##

An organization's information can be in simple files on servers, computers, or smaller devices, as well as in databases within server farms. To safeguard this information, logical access controls are implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Access control models usually treat information as an object and manage access based on user credentials. For example, to ensure confidentiality, a system verifies a user's credentials before allowing access, thus blocking unauthorized users from viewing the data.

Restricted access also aims to preserve the integrity of information by allowing only authorized and properly trained and aware individuals to make changes. Security policies often integrate access control systems to enforce both confidentiality and integrity: only authorized personnel can access the policies, and only designated users, such as those from specific departments, are allowed to alter them. Moreover, if the system supports logging and version tracking, it enforces non repudiation by recording all changes made.

Different types of information require different levels of protection, which can change over time. For example, while stock ownership information is usually public, stock trades are kept confidential until execution to gain a competitive advantage. Once a trade is executed and becomes public, the need for confidentiality shifts. 

## 5.1.2 Systems ##

The term "system" can be challenging to define, as it generally refers to a combination of hardware, software, personnel, policies, procedures, and other resources. While "system" often pertains to electronic information systems, understanding the full scope of these systems, including analog processes, hard-copy data, and electronic components, is essential for designing effective identity and access management (IAM) controls.

Systems may have various security requirements, including the need to ensure confidentiality, availability, and integrity of critical information, as well as the availability of the system itself and the authenticity and nonrepudiation of its users. Implementing proper access controls is crucial to maintaining the security and privacy of data. These controls support fundamental security principles such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Nonrepudiation (CIANA) already mentioned.

## 5.1.3 Devices ##

In access control models, devices can be both objects and subjects. Devices that contain sensitive data or provide access to critical functions require controlled access as objects. They can also act as subjects or non-human users; device identifiers like fingerprints, digital certificates, or cookies can be used to authenticate devices. If a new or untrusted device attempts to access sensitive information, the access control system should enforce additional authentication measures, such as MFA, before granting access. 

Devices are integral components of information systems and, as such, require effective identity and access management (IAM). User workstations such as laptops, desktops, and tablets function as complete information systems with capabilities for storage, processing, and networking, necessitating stringent security measures like restricted logical access. The rise of cloud computing has further expanded the range of devices an organization must manage, as these services can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

A key aspect of device IAM is ensuring that only authorized users can access these devices. 

:bulb: The proliferation of new device types has introduced IAM challenges, such as early smartphones that only supported simple four-digit PINs rather than more complex passwords. However, advancements in technology have brought benefits, including the widespread availability of biometric sensors like fingerprint readers and facial recognition scanners. These technologies, now more affordable and effective, enhance multi factor authentication (MFA) options.

Effective IAM for devices also involves robust endpoint security. Practices like endpoint detection and response (EDR) are crucial for monitoring and managing device security. Access controls should be applied to ensure device security. For instance, an asset inventory in a mobile device management (MDM) system should track the owner or custodian of each device, aiding incident response if a device is compromised.

The portability of modern devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, presents a challenge to confidentiality. These devices are small and lightweight, making them susceptible to theft, loss, or unauthorized access if left unattended. Tools like MDM can mitigate these risks with features such as:

- **Device Protection:** Enforces security policies like password complexity, software updates, and app restrictions. EDR software can detect suspicious activity and take protective actions like quarantining, locking, or wiping the device.
- **Device Restrictions:** Identifies unsupported hardware or jailbroken systems that bypass standard restrictions. Jailbreaking can compromise device security by removing manufacturer protections.
- **Remote Lock or Wipe:** Allows organizations to lock or erase data from a device if it is stolen or lost. Remote lock can be reversed if the device is recovered, while remote wipe deletes data or renders the device unusable, typically used when recovery is unlikely.
- **Containerization:** Isolates organizational data within a logical container on a personal device, limiting access by other apps. This approach is useful for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, where restrictions are applied to the container rather than the entire device. The container can be locked or wiped if necessary.

Physical access controls also play a crucial role in device security. In an office setting, physical controls protect all devices within the facility. However, portable devices that leave the secure environment pose a challenge. Users must be trained to secure devices appropriately, such as avoiding leaving them unattended in public or securing them in an unmarked bag or hotel safe during travel.

## 5.1.4 Facilities ##

Facilities offer essential security for all the systems, devices, and information they house, making robust protection crucial. Physical security is a key aspect of information system security—if an attacker gains physical access to a device, even the most sophisticated logical security measures may fail to prevent unauthorized data access.

Traditional physical security practices for facilities typically employ a secure perimeter approach, using many layers of defense to enhance security progressively. They are usually a combination of surveillance, detection, and authentication systems to prevent unauthorized entry. Surveillance systems like CCTV cameras provide real-time monitoring and recording of entry points, ensuring visual oversight and deterrence. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), such as motion sensors, infrared detectors, and alarm systems, detect unauthorized movement and trigger alerts to security personnel or automated response mechanisms. Physical access control systems (PACS), including RFID badges, biometric scanners, and smart card readers, authenticate individuals and enforce entry restrictions based on predefined access policies. These systems often integrate with security management platforms to provide centralized monitoring, logging, and real-time response to security incidents.

## 5.1.5 Applications ##

Applications often serve as gateways to an organization’s data, making it crucial to control access to these applications to protect sensitive information. Here are three key points explaining why we should protect Applications of our company:

**Data Protection:** Applications frequently handle and process sensitive or critical data. By controlling access to these applications, an organization can prevent unauthorized users from accessing, manipulating, or leaking this data.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Many industries are subject to regulations that require strict data protection measures. Controlling access to applications helps organizations comply with these regulations by ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

**Minimizing Risks:** Applications can be vulnerable to various types of cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. Proper access control mitigates these risks by limiting exposure to only those individuals who need access for their roles.

## 5.1.6 Services ##

Services refer to the various functions or processes provided by an information system, network, or application to support the needs of users or other systems. These services can range from basic functions like file storage and retrieval to more complex ones like data processing, authentication, email delivery, and cloud-based operations. Controlling access to these services is critical to ensuring that only authorized users or systems can use them, safeguarding the organization’s data and infrastructure.
