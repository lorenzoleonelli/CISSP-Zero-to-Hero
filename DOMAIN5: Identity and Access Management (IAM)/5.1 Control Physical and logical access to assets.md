## 5.1 Control Physical and logical access to assets ##

Access control encompasses the systems and processes designed to safeguard an organization’s assets while ensuring that only authorized individuals have the appropriate level of access. Core principles of access control include:
1. **need-to-know:** restricts access to information or resources based strictly on a user’s necessity to perform their job. Users are only given access to the specific data or systems required to complete their tasks, minimizing exposure to unnecessary or sensitive information.
2. **least privilege:** ensures that users or systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their assigned duties. By limiting permissions, it reduces the potential damage caused by accidental misuse or unauthorized access.
3. **separation of duties:** involves dividing responsibilities and privileges among multiple individuals or systems to prevent conflicts of interest or the misuse of power. No single person should have enough access or control to carry out critical tasks independently, reducing the risk of fraud, errors, or abuse.

:necktie: These controls apply across all organizational levels and to all asset types (both physical and logical), ensuring comprehensive protection and regulated access.

Access control systems are designed to regulate who or what (referred to as **subjects**) can interact with specific assets (referred to as **objects**). These objects include data such as files and system resources like networks and computing power. In a physical context, access control involves securing facilities, like offices and server rooms, which are considered critical assets.

Subjects, which can be either human users or automated systems (e.g., devices or software processes), need access to these objects. Access control ensures that these interactions follow specific rules, determining who can read, write, or otherwise use a particular resource. For example, a user may be allowed to read a file but restricted from editing it, while a nonhuman entity like a system process may be permitted access based on the sensitivity of the data involved.

Physical security involves controlling entry into sensitive areas, such as server rooms. For instance, server rooms often employ cipher locks, whereas lower-priority objects like desktop computers may just have basic security measures like physical locks. These protections extend to servers, which house crucial organizational data and applications. Logical access controls, on the other hand, use technical measures—such as authentication and authorization—to regulate access to systems, networks, and sensitive information.

The ultimate goal of access control systems is to prevent the loss of the three core security attributes (CIA Triad):
- Confidentiality: Ensuring only authorized entities can access sensitive data.
- Integrity: Protecting systems and data from unauthorized alterations.
- Availability: Ensuring authorized users can access data and systems when needed.

Sometimes, two more principles are added to the CIA triad: Non-repudiation (ensuring actions can't be denied) and Authenticity (verifying that users and systems are genuine). This is called CIANA, which covers a broader range of security goals.

Access control is fundamentally about regulating interactions between entities (subjects) and resources (objects) within an environment that requires security. The goal is to mediate and enforce access permissions to ensure that only authorized subjects can interact with specific objects based on predefined policies and security requirements.
The following picture recaps some of the concepts above explained and the concepts of labeling and marking taken from Domain 2.

As a security professional you should recognize, assess and protect all the following assets:

**Information:** This is all the data the organization stores on servers, computers, and smaller devices. It can be simple files or large databases. Logical access controls prevent unauthorized access to this information.

**Systems:** These are IT systems that provide services, like a file server or a web server supporting e-commerce. Permissions manage access to these systems.

**Devices:** This includes routers, switches, servers, computers, tablets, smartphones, and printers. Even if employees use personal devices, any organizational data stored on them is still an asset.

**Facilities:** This refers to the physical locations owned or rented by the organization, like buildings or rooms. Physical security controls protect these spaces.

**Applications:** Applications offer access to data and services. Managing access to these with permissions adds another layer of security.

**Services:** These are the activities or functions provided by an organization’s systems, like email or cloud storage. Controlling access to services ensures they’re used properly and securely.


:bulb: In most operating systems, access control rules define the permissions or rights that a user (or subject) has over resources (objects) such as files, directories, or processes. These rules typically fall under various logical access modes that determine the level of interaction a subject can have with an object. The basic access modes are:
- Create: Allows a subject to create a new object (e.g., creating a new file).
- Update: Allows a subject to modify an existing object (e.g., editing a file).
- Read: Allows a subject to view the content of an object (e.g., reading a document).
- Read/Write: Allows both reading and modifying an object.
- Execute: Allows a subject to run or execute an object (e.g., running a program).
- Delete: Allows a subject to remove an object from the system (e.g., deleting a file).

In Windows-based systems, access control is implemented using Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs define which users or groups can perform specific actions on an object. Windows permissions are typically more granular, and permissions like Read, Write, Execute, and Delete can be explicitly set for different users or groups. Windows also allows setting permissions on a file or folder, including special permissions for various administrative tasks.

Unix and Linux systems use a simpler, more straightforward owner-group-other model for access control, where permissions are set for the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and others (everyone else). Each of these categories can be granted Read (r), Write (w), and Execute (x) permissions. Unix systems use a more numeric approach (e.g., 755) to represent permission settings. Additionally, sudo allows users to elevate their privileges temporarily, giving them higher levels of access based on predefined roles.

One major aspect of IAM implementation is the method of decision-making and enforcement:

- Centralized IAM: Involves a dedicated team and system overseeing all access control activities. This approach ensures rigorous oversight and monitoring but can introduce a single point of failure.
- Decentralized IAM: Distributes access control decisions to system or information owners, allowing for greater flexibility and freedom. However, this can lead to inconsistent enforcement and a lack of unified oversight.
- Hybrid IAM: Combines elements of both centralized and decentralized approaches. It allows certain access control decisions to be made centrally while giving system owners the freedom to manage specific areas. This approach aims to balance oversight with flexibility.

## 5.1.1 Information ##

An organization's information can be in simple files on servers, computers, or smaller devices, as well as in databases within server farms. To safeguard this information, logical access controls are implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Access control models usually treat information as an object and manage access based on user credentials. For example, to ensure confidentiality, a system verifies a user's credentials before allowing access, thus blocking unauthorized users from viewing the data.

Restricted access also aims to preserve the integrity of information by allowing only authorized and properly trained and aware individuals to make changes. Security policies often integrate access control systems to enforce both confidentiality and integrity: only authorized personnel can access the policies, and only designated users, such as those from specific departments, are allowed to alter them. Moreover, if the system supports logging and version tracking, it enforces non repudiation by recording all changes made.

Different types of information require different levels of protection, which can change over time. For example, while stock ownership information is usually public, stock trades are kept confidential until execution to gain a competitive advantage. Once a trade is executed and becomes public, the need for confidentiality shifts. 

## 5.1.2 Systems ##

The term "system" can be challenging to define, as it generally refers to a combination of hardware, software, personnel, policies, procedures, and other resources. While "system" often pertains to electronic information systems, understanding the full scope of these systems, including analog processes, hard-copy data, and electronic components, is essential for designing effective identity and access management (IAM) controls.

Systems may have various security requirements, including the need to ensure confidentiality, availability, and integrity of critical information, as well as the availability of the system itself and the authenticity and nonrepudiation of its users. Implementing proper access controls is crucial to maintaining the security and privacy of data. These controls support fundamental security principles such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Nonrepudiation (CIANA) already mentioned.
