8. What is log review in security testing?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Log review involves **examining system logs** for unusual activities, errors, or security incidents, helping detect potential breaches or misconfigurations early. </details>

9. What are synthetic transactions, and how are they used in security testing?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Synthetic transactions **simulate user interactions** with an application or system to assess performance and security under controlled conditions, replicating normal usage behavior. </details>

10. Why is code review important in security testing?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Code review helps **identify vulnerabilities, bugs, and security flaws** in software before deployment, reducing the risk of exploitation by attackers. </details>

11. What is misuse case testing in security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Misuse case testing **simulates malicious actions or unintended use** of a system, helping identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. </details>

12. What is coverage analysis in security testing?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Coverage analysis evaluates **how well security tests cover the system**, ensuring that all potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities are assessed. </details>

13. What does interface testing focus on?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Interface testing evaluates **interactions between systems or components**—such as user interfaces, network interfaces, or APIs—to detect security flaws or misconfigurations. </details>

14. What is a breach attack simulation?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A breach attack simulation **mimics real-world attacks** to assess how well a system or organization can detect, respond, and recover from cyber threats. </details>

15. What is the purpose of compliance checks in security testing?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Compliance checks ensure systems, processes, and practices **meet regulatory, legal, and organizational security requirements**, helping prevent penalties and vulnerabilities. </details>

16. How does account management contribute to security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Account management ensures **user accounts are properly created, maintained, and removed** according to security policies, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. </details>

17. What role does management review and approval play in security processes?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Management review and approval ensure **security policies, plans, and decisions** are aligned with organizational goals and formally endorsed by leadership. </details>

18. What are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in security management?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> KPIs are **measurable values** used to evaluate how well an organization is achieving its security objectives and goals, guiding decisions and improvements. </details>

19. How do Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) differ from KPIs in security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> KRIs monitor **potential risks** to an organization’s security posture, providing early warnings of vulnerabilities or threats, whereas KPIs measure performance against security objectives. </details>

20. What is backup verification data, and why is it important?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Backup verification data ensures that **backup systems and data are intact, functional, and restorable**, which is critical for disaster recovery and business continuity. </details>

21. Why is training and awareness critical to security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Training and awareness programs **educate employees** about security risks, policies, and best practices, reducing human errors and strengthening overall security. </details>

22. What is the difference between Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC)?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> DR focuses on **restoring systems and data** after an incident, while BC ensures that **critical business functions continue** without disruption during and after disasters. </details>

23. How does remediation address security vulnerabilities?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Remediation involves **implementing corrective actions** to resolve identified vulnerabilities, restoring security and reducing the risk of exploitation. </details>

24. What is exception handling in the context of security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Exception handling involves **identifying, documenting, and responding** to deviations from expected security behaviors or policies, mitigating any adverse impact. </details>

25. What is ethical disclosure in cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Ethical disclosure refers to **responsibly reporting vulnerabilities** to affected parties, allowing time for remediation before public disclosure. </details>

26. How do internal security audits contribute to cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Internal audits help organizations **assess their own security measures** and identify improvement areas, ensuring compliance with policies and identifying potential weaknesses. </details>
