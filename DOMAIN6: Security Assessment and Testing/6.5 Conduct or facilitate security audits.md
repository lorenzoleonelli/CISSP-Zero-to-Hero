## 6.5.0 Preface ##

Auditing is one of the key ways organizations check whether their security policies, controls, and processes are actually working as intended. 

:necktie: Auditing as a formal, structured way to validate that systems are both compliant with standards and protected against threats.

Audits help uncover weak points in an organization’s defenses, gaps in compliance, or evidence that processes aren’t being followed. They’re not limited to technical systems — they can also apply to management, training, documentation, and even vendor security.

A full audit of every system, file, user, and process would be too big and too expensive for almost any organization. That’s why auditors often rely on sampling.

**Sampling** means checking a portion of the total data or systems instead of everything. For example, instead of reviewing every single user account on a server, an auditor might select a representative group of accounts and check those. If the sample shows consistent problems, it's a sign the whole system might have similar issues. If the sample is clean, the controls are likely working properly

Sampling saves time and money but still gives organizations reasonable confidence about their security posture. There are different sampling techniques, such as:
- Random sampling (select items at random to test)
- Stratified sampling (divide into groups and sample from each group)
- Judgmental sampling (based on the auditor’s experience, picking “high risk” areas to check)

:bulb: Sampling is especially useful when dealing with large and complex systems, like cloud environments, distributed networks, or organizations with multiple offices.

Several well-known frameworks guide auditors on what to check, how to check it, and what to document. These frameworks help create consistency, so audits are reliable and comparable:

## 6.5.1 Internal (e.g., within organization control) ##

An internal audit is a structured, independent review performed inside an organization to make sure security controls, policies, and procedures are working as expected. While external audits are often done by third parties, internal audits are carried out by the company’s own security, compliance, or audit teams.

The goal of an internal audit is not to "catch" people making mistakes, but to confirm that the organization is actually doing what it says it’s doing — and to identify any gaps before attackers or regulators do.

An internal audit typically follows a clear cycle:

    C --> C2[Identify gaps, noncompliance, weaknesses]

    D --> D1[Write clear, factual report]
    D --> D2[Include risk ratings and recommendations]

    E --> E1[Business/IT team fixes problems]
    E --> E2[Internal auditors follow up to verify fixes]

```

Internal audits are a proactive tool. They:
- Help the organization meet legal, regulatory, and customer security expectations.
- Catch security issues before they become real problems.
- Prepare teams for external audits or certifications.
- Build a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.

:necktie: A strong internal audit process helps turn assumptions into facts and creates a safer, more reliable environment.

## 6.5.2 External (e.g., outside organization control) ##

An external audit is when an independent team — usually from a professional auditing firm or regulatory body — evaluates an organization’s security controls, policies, and practices. The goal is to confirm that the organization meets security standards, legal requirements, and its own internal policies.

Unlike internal audits, which are performed by your own staff, external audits bring in outside experts who are not part of your daily operations. This helps ensure that the review is objective, thorough, and free from internal bias or oversight blind spots.

External audits help an organization to:
- Validate its security posture from an independent and unbiased perspective.
- Demonstrate compliance with regulatory, contractual, or industry standards.
- Discover gaps and weaknesses that internal teams might miss.
- Build trust with customers, regulators, and leadership by providing formal proof of security maturity.

In some industries, regular external audits are not optional — they are mandatory for operating legally, handling sensitive data, or maintaining specific certifications (like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, or SOC 2).
An external audit usually follows a structured process:

```mermaid

:necktie: External audits are a critical checkpoint for cybersecurity programs. They give leadership, regulators, and business partners confidence that an organization’s security isn’t just good on paper — it’s good in practice.
While internal teams handle day-to-day monitoring and risk management, external audits provide a fresh set of eyes to ensure nothing is missed and that security investments are producing the right results.

## 6.5.3 Third-party (e.g., outside of enterprise control) ##

A third-party audit is an independent assessment of a vendor, supplier, or partner’s security controls. The goal is to confirm that the third party follows good security practices and meets the required standards — especially when they handle your organization’s data, systems, or services.

This process helps ensure that a company’s security isn't just strong inside its own walls, but also across its entire supply chain.

Third-party audits are usually performed by external, independent auditing firms or specialists — not by the company itself, and not by the vendor being audited. The auditor’s job is to be neutral and to deliver clear findings.

Sometimes the audit is part of a contractual agreement; other times it’s done before signing a contract, or during vendor re-qualification.

### Open Questions ###

1. Why are third-party audits important for cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Third-party audits are important because even if your internal systems are secure, a vendor or partner’s weak security could still expose your organization to breaches or data loss. They help ensure that external parties handling your data maintain adequate protections. </details>

2. Who typically performs a third-party audit, and why must they be independent?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Third-party audits are usually performed by independent external auditors. Independence is crucial to ensure the findings are unbiased and credible for both the organization and the vendor, providing trust in the audit results. </details>

3. What kind of security aspects are usually reviewed during a third-party audit?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> A third-party audit typically reviews policies, technical security controls, physical protections, incident response readiness, and compliance with recognized standards.

## 6.5.4 Location (e.g., on-premises, cloud, hybrid) ##

When planning or performing a security audit, it’s important to understand where the systems, data, and controls are located — this directly affects how the audit is done. In modern environments, organizations often use a mix of different setups: on-premises, cloud, or hybrid. Each location type brings different risks, tools, and audit considerations.

**On-Premises Audits.** On-premises means the systems, servers, and data storage are physically located inside the organization’s buildings, usually in company-owned data centers. Auditors can directly inspect physical security (locks, badges, CCTV), network devices, and server configurations. On-premises audits give clear visibility and control but require access to the physical location and staff.

**Cloud Audits.** In cloud environments, data and systems live on servers owned by cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Auditors focus less on physical security and more on the shared responsibility model, where the cloud provider secures the infrastructure, but the customer is responsible for configurations, identity management, and data protection. Cloud audits rely heavily on documentation, logs, security policies, and sometimes provider certifications (like ISO 27001 or SOC 2 reports).

**Hybrid Audits.** Many companies combine both approaches — some systems run on-premises while others are hosted in the cloud. This is called a hybrid environment. Hybrid audits must cover both the physical world and the virtual/cloud world. This means auditors will verify internal processes, cloud configurations, data flows between systems, and how security is maintained across both locations.
