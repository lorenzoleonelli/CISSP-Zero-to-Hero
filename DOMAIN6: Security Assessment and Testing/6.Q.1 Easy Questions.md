## Easy Questions ##

1. During the interface testing of a multi-tier web application used by a healthcare organization, it was discovered that there is inadequate separation between the presentation layer and the data access layer. What is the most likely security consequence of this architectural issue?

A. Direct exposure of sensitive patient data queries to manipulation from the client side
B. Limited scalability, making it difficult to integrate new healthcare technologies
C. Challenges in implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the client side
D. Reduced performance due to excessive communication between client and server

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Direct exposure of sensitive patient data queries to manipulation from the client side

Explanation:
Inadequate separation between the presentation and data access layers can allow attackers to manipulate queries or requests directly from the client side, potentially exposing sensitive healthcare data. This is a critical violation of the principle of layered defense.

❌ Wrong Answers:

D. Reduced performance: A secondary concern, not the key security issue.

B. Limited scalability: A design limitation, but unrelated to data exposure.

C. Challenges in MFA: Not directly affected by layer separation flaws.

2. You are responsible for implementing a comprehensive security assessment and testing program for your organization. Which of the following is not typically included in such a program?

A. Security Tests
B. Security Audits
C. Threat Hunting
D. Security Assessments

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C. Threat Hunting

Explanation:
Threat hunting is a proactive activity that searches for adversaries within an environment but is not typically part of a formal assessment and testing program, which focuses on verifying and validating security controls.

❌ Wrong Answers:
Security tests, audits, and assessments are all core elements of a structured testing program as defined by NIST and ISO frameworks.

3. You are tasked with planning your company’s security strategy. Which of the following sources is least likely to provide strategic value?

A. NIST SP 800-53
B. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysis results
C. Internal audit results
D. ISO 27001

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. OSINT analysis results

Explanation:
OSINT is valuable for understanding external threats, but not ideal for shaping internal strategy. Frameworks and audit results provide a more solid foundation for structured policy design.

4. How can John evaluate the performance of a crucial web application’s rarely used features without waiting for user complaints?

A. User targeting
B. Unit testing
C. Bot emulation
D. Synthetic transactions

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. Synthetic transactions

Explanation:
Synthetic transactions mimic real user interactions in a controlled, automated way. They allow continuous monitoring of performance and reliability without depending on actual user activity.

❌ Wrong Answers:

Unit testing: Validates code units, not end-to-end performance.

Bot emulation: Lacks the depth and control of synthetic testing.

User targeting: Focuses on segmentation, not technical assessment.

5. You are scheduling security testing for a sensitive financial application. Which factors should be considered? (Choose three)

A. Sensitivity of stored information
B. Awareness of available tools
C. Potential DoS impact
D. Testing costs

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answers: A, C, D

Explanation:
These factors determine test frequency, timing, and risk tolerance. Sensitivity and potential DoS impact guide criticality; costs balance resource allocation.

❌ Wrong Answer:
B. Awareness of tools doesn’t directly affect scheduling decisions.
