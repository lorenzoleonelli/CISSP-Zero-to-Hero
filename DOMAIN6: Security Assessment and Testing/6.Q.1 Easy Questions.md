## 6.Q.1 Easy Questions ##

1. During the interface testing of a multi-tier web application used by a healthcare organization, it was discovered that there is inadequate separation between the presentation layer and the data access layer. What is the most likely security consequence of this architectural issue?

A. Direct exposure of sensitive patient data queries to manipulation from the client side

B. Limited scalability, making it difficult to integrate new healthcare technologies

C. Challenges in implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the client side

D. Reduced performance due to excessive communication between client and server

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: A. Direct exposure of sensitive patient data queries to manipulation from the client side

Explanation:
Inadequate separation between the presentation and data access layers can allow attackers to manipulate queries or requests directly from the client side, potentially exposing sensitive healthcare data. This is a critical violation of the principle of layered defense.

❌ Wrong Answers:

D. Reduced performance: A secondary concern, not the key security issue.

B. Limited scalability: A design limitation, but unrelated to data exposure.

C. Challenges in MFA: Not directly affected by layer separation flaws.

2. You are responsible for implementing a comprehensive security assessment and testing program for your organization. Which of the following is not typically included in such a program?

A. Security Tests

B. Security Audits

C. Threat Hunting

D. Security Assessments

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C. Threat Hunting

Explanation:
Threat hunting is a proactive activity that searches for adversaries within an environment but is not typically part of a formal assessment and testing program, which focuses on verifying and validating security controls.

❌ Wrong Answers:
Security tests, audits, and assessments are all core elements of a structured testing program as defined by NIST and ISO frameworks.

3. You are tasked with planning your company’s security strategy. Which of the following sources is least likely to provide strategic value?

A. NIST SP 800-53

B. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysis results

C. Internal audit results

D. ISO 27001

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. OSINT analysis results

Explanation:
OSINT is valuable for understanding external threats, but not ideal for shaping internal strategy. Frameworks and audit results provide a more solid foundation for structured policy design.

4. How can John evaluate the performance of a crucial web application’s rarely used features without waiting for user complaints?

A. User targeting

B. Unit testing

C. Bot emulation

D. Synthetic transactions

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. Synthetic transactions

Explanation:
Synthetic transactions mimic real user interactions in a controlled, automated way. They allow continuous monitoring of performance and reliability without depending on actual user activity.

❌ Wrong Answers:

Unit testing: Validates code units, not end-to-end performance.

Bot emulation: Lacks the depth and control of synthetic testing.

User targeting: Focuses on segmentation, not technical assessment.

5. You are scheduling security testing for a sensitive financial application. Which factors should be considered? (Choose three)

A. Sensitivity of stored information

B. Awareness of available tools

C. Potential DoS impact

D. Testing costs

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answers: A, C, D

Explanation:
These factors determine test frequency, timing, and risk tolerance. Sensitivity and potential DoS impact guide criticality; costs balance resource allocation.

❌ Wrong Answer:
B. Awareness of tools doesn’t directly affect scheduling decisions.

6. Your organization has recently acquired a vulnerability scanner with the purpose of detecting security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications. Which of the following is not a direct benefit of vulnerability scanning?

A. Pinpoints a specific group of computers for conducting vulnerability analysis.

B. Detects unauthorized file modifications.

C. Lists the arrangement of the network and identifies the group of active hosts and related software.

D. Discovers possible vulnerabilities within the selected group of active hosts.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: B. Detects unauthorized file modifications.

Explanation:
Detecting unauthorized file modifications is typically the responsibility of Integrity Checkers, not vulnerability scanners.

Vulnerability scanners are designed to:

Identify network configurations and discover active hosts with associated software.

Pinpoint specific systems for focused analysis.

Detect potential vulnerabilities and verify patch levels.

These tools help maintain system security posture but do not monitor real-time integrity changes.

7. As a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), it’s your responsibility to ensure that all necessary documentation and approvals are in place before beginning a comprehensive vulnerability test on your organization’s systems. Which of the following documents must you possess before initiating a comprehensive vulnerability test?

A. Written agreement with the authorities

B. Policies and Procedures

C. Code of Conduct

D. Written agreement with the management

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. Written agreement with the management

Explanation:
A written agreement with management provides official authorization for testing activities.
It defines the scope, objectives, and permissions of the vulnerability test and ensures accountability and legal coverage.

❌ Wrong Answers:

A. Agreement with authorities: Only required for testing government systems.

B. Policies and Procedures: Offer guidance but not authorization.

C. Code of Conduct: Defines ethics, not permissions.

This document ensures that management formally endorses the test, preventing misunderstandings or unauthorized activity.

8. Your company is working with a third-party service provider to handle critical financial transactions. To ensure that the provider maintains adequate controls and accurate monitoring, you must assess the relevant SOC report. Which of the following SOC reports is most appropriate for verifying continuous financial controls and accuracy over a period of time?

A. SOC 2 Type 2

B. SOC 2 Type 1

C. SOC 1 Type 1

D. SOC 1 Type 2

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: D. SOC 1 Type 2

Explanation:
A SOC 1 Type 2 report evaluates the operational effectiveness of financial control processes over time.
It ensures that the provider’s systems support reliable financial reporting throughout the assessed period.

❌ Wrong Answers:

SOC 1 Type 1: Only reviews design at a single point in time.

SOC 2 Type 1 / Type 2: Assess trust principles (security, privacy, availability) but not financial processes.

SOC 1 Type 2 is essential when ongoing assurance of financial control reliability is required.

9. Your company is planning to conduct a penetration test to evaluate its security posture. As part of the planning phase, you need to determine which activities are typically included in a penetration test. Which of the following is not a standard activity in a penetration test?

A. Personnel security

B. IT systems

C. Contract verification

D. Physical security

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

✅ Correct Answer: C. Contract verification

Contract verification deals with reviewing legal or compliance documentation, not system vulnerabilities.
Penetration testing focuses on identifying and exploiting weaknesses in systems, applications, or physical security controls.

❌ Wrong Answers:

A. Personnel security: Assessed during social engineering or phishing simulations.

B. IT systems: Core focus of penetration testing.

D. Physical security: Can be tested by attempting to bypass physical barriers.

Penetration testing aims to simulate real-world attacks, not to review administrative paperwork.
