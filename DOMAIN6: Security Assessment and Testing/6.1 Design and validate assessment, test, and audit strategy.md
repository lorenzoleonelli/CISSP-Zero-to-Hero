## 6.1 Design and validate assessment, test, and audit strategy ##

We've spent all this time learning how to build a secure environment… now it’s time to verify if it actually is secure. Tests, assessments, and audits are the tools security professionals use to uncover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and procedural weaknesses before attackers do. Domain 6 teaches how to look under the hood of your security program and answer the big question: “*Are we really protected?*”

**Testing** is like doing a fire drill. Penetration tests (pen tests), vulnerability scans, and security functional tests are about simulating attacks, checking what works, and what doesn’t. These are often technical, hands-on, and actively probe systems to see what breaks.

**Assessments** are broader and more strategic. They’re not about “hacking the system,” but evaluating the overall posture—how well policies are followed, how risks are identified, and where improvements are needed. These can include risk assessments, security assessments, and gap analyses. They’re the “health checkups” of your security ecosystem.

**Audits** are even more formal, often tied to compliance and regulations. Whether internal or external, an audit checks if you're actually doing what you say you're doing. Think policies, procedures, logs, and documentation. Auditors follow a structured process to verify controls are in place and functioning—because regulators and stakeholders need proof, not promises.

:necktie: We don’t secure a system by installing firewalls and crossing out fingers. We need a feedback loop—a cycle of testing, evaluating, and adjusting. Domain 6 is about holding our systems, processes, and people accountable—and building confidence that your defenses are real, not theoretical.

:link: [NIST SP 800-53A Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/a/r5/final) defines Four Types of Assessment Objects (what can be assessed):
- Specifications – Documents such as policies, plans, procedures, or system security plans.
- Mechanisms – Security functions or features (e.g., encryption, access control).
- Activities – Operations performed by people or systems (e.g., monitoring, backups).
- Individuals – People performing roles (e.g., security officers, admins).

And Four Components of an Assessment Approach (how to assess):
- Assessment Object – The target (specifications, mechanisms, activities, individuals).
- Assessment Method – How you assess (examine, interview, test).
- Assessment Procedure – The step-by-step guide to performing the assessment.
- Assessment Result – The output (pass/fail, compliant/non-compliant, findings).


## 6.1.1 Internal (e.g., within organization control) ##

Internal testing involves simulating attacks or failure scenarios in a controlled way to see how systems respond. These tests are often performed by in-house security teams or internal red/blue teams. Here are some common types:

1. Internal Penetration Testing: Simulates an attack from someone who already has access to the internal network. It identifies vulnerabilities such as unpatched systems, misconfigured firewalls, or excessive privileges.
2. Phishing Simulations: Tests user awareness and the effectiveness of email filters. Employees receive fake phishing emails to see who clicks or enters credentials.
3. Vulnerability Scanning: Automated tools scan systems and applications for known weaknesses. It’s less intrusive than a pentest and often used more frequently.
4. Tabletop Exercises: A simulated incident response meeting where team members walk through a cyberattack scenario. It’s a low-tech, high-impact way to test incident response plans.
5. Red Team/Blue Team Exercises: Red teams act as attackers; blue teams defend. These exercises measure detection and response capability in real time.

These internal tests provide insights into technical and human weaknesses, and help validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.

An **internal audit**, or **first-party audit**, is a structured, formal review conducted by the organization itself. The goal is to verify compliance with internal policies, industry standards, and regulatory requirements. Unlike testing, which often focuses on breaking or bypassing defenses, internal audits focus on documentation, processes, and adherence.

Examples of what internal audits might review are:
- Are user access reviews being conducted quarterly, as the policy says?
- Are backup procedures tested regularly and logs maintained?
- Is encryption being used consistently where it’s required by policy or regulation?
- Are employees trained in data handling procedures?

Internal audits are often performed by an internal audit department, risk and compliance teams, or even security personnel who are trained in audit techniques.

One key challenge with internal audits is the potential for conflict of interest. When someone reviews a process they helped design or manage, it’s difficult to be completely objective.

Some examples of conflict include:
- A sysadmin auditing their own patching practices.
- A security manager evaluating the performance of a team they supervise.
- An audit report being downplayed to avoid "bad news" reaching senior leadership.

To mitigate these risks, organizations should:
- Use independent teams within the company.
- Rotate auditors to avoid familiarity bias.
- Report audit results directly to senior leadership or the board.
- Supplement internal audits with periodic third-party (external) audits for critical areas.
