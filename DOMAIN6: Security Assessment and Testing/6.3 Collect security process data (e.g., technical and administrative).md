## Account management ##

Account Management is the set of processes and controls used to create, monitor, update, and delete user accounts in an IT environment. Whether you're dealing with a corporate network, cloud platforms, or physical access systems, proper account management ensures that only the right people have the right access at the right time.

In cybersecurity, account management is critical because user accounts are often the first and most common entry point for attackers. Weak, stale, or overly-permissive accounts can allow attackers to bypass security defenses. Compromised accounts can be used to move laterally through systems, steal data, and escalate privileges. That's why modern security programs treat account management as a core defense measure, not just an administrative task.

When account management is handled poorly, systems are at higher risk of both internal and external attacks. Common account-related issues include:
- Orphaned accounts (accounts that still exist after the user has left the company).
- Default passwords or shared passwords.
- Accounts with excessive privileges ("admin rights everywhere").
- Old accounts that haven’t been logged into for months or years.
- Disabled logging or monitoring for account activity.

:necktie: A single compromised account can lead to complete system takeover if privileges are not properly controlled.

Account management typically covers three main areas:
| Category                  | Description | Examples / Key Points |
|----------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Administrative Process** | Defines and enforces policies on how user accounts are handled, ensuring consistency and alignment with business/security goals. | - What information is needed to create an account?<br>- Who can approve access?<br>- How are roles and permissions assigned?<br>- How often are accounts reviewed?<br>- What is the offboarding process when someone leaves? |
| **Technical Implementation** | Covers systems and tools to manage accounts securely, ensuring reliable policy enforcement and visibility of violations. | - Use of centralized identity systems (Active Directory, LDAP, Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace).<br>- Enforced password policies (length, complexity, expiration).<br>- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).<br>- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).<br>- Logging and monitoring of account usage. |
| **Physical Controls** | Physical protections that prevent attackers from bypassing account protections by gaining direct access to devices or servers. | - Control access to buildings, server rooms, and workstations.<br>- Use hardware tokens or smart cards for identity verification.<br>- Enforce screen lockouts and device encryption. |

Account management is often structured around the Join-Move-Leave model:

| Account Lifecycle Stage | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Join** | When a new person joins the organization, an account is created for them based on their job role. Permissions are assigned following the principle of least privilege — only giving them the minimum access needed for their work. |
| **Move** | When a person changes roles, their account permissions should be updated. Old access (from the previous job) should be removed, and new permissions added based on the new responsibilities. Many breaches happen because old access was not removed during role changes. |
| **Leave** | When someone leaves the company, their account must be disabled or deleted immediately. Dormant accounts are one of the easiest ways for attackers to maintain access to a system after a breach. |


:ncktie: Account management is a combination of policy, technology, and people. When done right, it ensures that users can work efficiently — while attackers stay out.

### Open Questions ###

1. What is account management and why is it important in cybersecurity?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Account management is the process of creating, managing, and removing user accounts in a system. It’s important because accounts control access, and poor management can allow attackers to enter and move through systems unnoticed. </details>

2. How can poor account management lead to security breaches?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Poor account management can leave old, unused, or overly-permissive accounts active, which attackers can exploit to steal data, escalate privileges, or maintain long-term access to a network. </details>

3. What are the main elements of account management in a secure system?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The main elements are: administrative processes (policies and approvals), technical implementation (identity systems, access controls, monitoring), and physical security (protecting devices and servers from direct tampering). </details>

4. What does the "Join-Move-Leave" model mean in account management?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> The "Join-Move-Leave" model describes the account lifecycle: creating accounts for new users (join), updating their access when roles change (move), and disabling or deleting accounts when they leave the organization (leave). </details>

5. How do technical controls like MFA and RBAC support account security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) makes it harder for attackers to use stolen passwords, while Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) limits what users can do, helping prevent unnecessary or dangerous access if an account is compromised. </details>

## 6.3.2 Management review and approval ##

Management Review and Approval is the process where leaders — not just technical teams — formally check and approve security policies, controls, test results, and risk decisions. This is important because cybersecurity is not only a technical problem; it’s also a business risk. Management must be aware of what protections are in place, what risks exist, and what decisions need to be made to reduce exposure. 

:necktie: Without management review, security activities might lack direction, proper funding, or business alignment.

Management is responsible for reviewing security assessment results, vulnerability scans, audit reports, and risk treatment plans. Their approval shows that the organization is taking ownership of its security — it also helps ensure that decisions are documented and that nothing is done informally or without oversight.

Many security frameworks and standards explicitly require management to perform these reviews and sign off on key decisions:
- ISO/IEC 27001 requires management to review the entire Information Security Management System (ISMS) at planned intervals. This includes analyzing audit results, performance metrics, nonconformities, and opportunities for improvement.
- NIST SP 800-53 emphasizes the need for security assessment results to be reviewed by authorizing officials (usually a management role) before systems are allowed to operate. This ensures risks are formally accepted or mitigated.
- SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls) audits require management to show evidence that they monitor and review the effectiveness of security controls. An auditor will ask to see these reviews during the SOC 2 reporting process.
- COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) requires management oversight for governance and security processes. COBIT stresses the importance of continuous monitoring, formal approval of risk decisions, and making sure business and IT are aligned.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Management review and approval are important because they ensure that security decisions are known, understood, and approved by business leaders — not just technical staff. It helps align security with business risk and makes sure nothing is left to chance. </details>

2. Which security frameworks specifically require management to review and approve security processes?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> Frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2, and COBIT all require management to formally review and approve security processes, risk decisions, and control effectiveness. </details>

3. How does ISO 27001 handle management review?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> In ISO 27001, management must regularly review the entire Information Security Management System (ISMS), check performance, look at audit results, and approve any improvements or changes. </details>

4. What role does management approval play before a system is put into production, according to NIST?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> According to NIST SP 800-53, management (called an "authorizing official") must review security assessment results and formally approve whether a system is safe to operate before it is used in production. </details>

5. How does SOC 2 auditing check for management involvement in security?

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary> In SOC 2 audits, management must show evidence that they review and monitor the effectiveness of security controls. Auditors often ask for meeting minutes, reports, or signatures proving this oversight happened. </details>
