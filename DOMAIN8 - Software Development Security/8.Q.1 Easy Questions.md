A. XML

B. CSV

C. JSON

D. SPML

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. JSON

Explanation:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is lightweight and supports multiple data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. It is easy to read and write for humans and is natively supported by JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for web applications and APIs. Its simplicity and efficiency make it the preferred format for data interchange between applications.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. XML:
XML is more verbose and complex than JSON. While it supports schema validation and rich structure, it is heavier and slower to parse, which can be a drawback in performance-critical applications. It suits document-centric data better than lightweight data interchange.

❌ B. CSV:
CSV is primarily used for tabular data. It lacks support for complex data types, nested data, or hierarchical relationships, making it less versatile for sharing diverse data types.

❌ D. SPML:
SPML (Service Provisioning Markup Language) is designed specifically for provisioning and managing user identities and resources. It is not a general-purpose data format, making it less suitable for sharing various data types across multiple applications.

2. In a high-security environment where protecting sensitive data is critical, which of the following container runtime security practices should be prioritized to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy?

A. Protecting all containers with MFA

B. Using an AI-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

C. Encrypting all data stored within containers using container runtime encryption

D. Storing containers in different Physical or Virtual machines

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. Encrypting all data stored within containers using container runtime encryption

Explanation:
Runtime refers to the phase when a program is actively running within its environment. Encrypting data inside containers ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains protected and unreadable without the decryption key. This directly safeguards data privacy and mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access—crucial in high-security environments.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ A. Protecting all containers with MFA:
MFA enhances user authentication but does not protect data privacy during runtime.

❌ B. Using an AI-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):
EDR focuses on detecting suspicious activities but does not directly secure data within containers. It’s a complementary measure rather than a primary method for runtime data protection.

❌ D. Storing containers in different Physical or Virtual machines:
Isolation can limit breach scope but is inefficient and does not inherently secure data inside containers.

3. You’re the lead security engineer for a company rolling out a new microservices-based application, and your priority is to ensure that each microservice, running in its own isolated environment, communicates securely with others. To achieve the highest level of protection against unauthorized access between these services, which security approach should you prioritize?

A. Adopt mutual TLS (mTLS) to enable robust service-to-service authentication and encryption, securing all microservice interactions.

B. Implement network segmentation policies using NAT to strictly isolate and control communication between microservices.

C. Set up API gateways with rate limiting to monitor and manage incoming traffic to each microservice, preventing potential abuse or overload.

D. Configure OAuth for seamless sharing of authorizations between microservices, streamlining secure access.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. Adopt mutual TLS (mTLS) to enable robust service-to-service authentication and encryption, securing all microservice interactions.

Explanation:
mTLS provides strong, bidirectional authentication between communicating microservices, ensuring both client and server verify each other's identities. It enforces encryption, preventing unauthorized access and securing sensitive data during transmission. In a microservices architecture, mTLS effectively reduces the attack surface by tightly controlling which services can interact.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Implement network segmentation policies using NAT:
While helpful in isolating network segments, NAT does not provide authentication or encryption, so it cannot fully prevent unauthorized service communication.

❌ C. Set up API gateways with rate limiting:
API gateways help manage traffic and prevent abuse but do not provide the robust authentication and encryption needed between microservices.

❌ D. Configure OAuth for seamless sharing of authorizations:
OAuth is designed for user-centric authorization and is not optimized for service-to-service authentication and encryption in microservices, adding unnecessary complexity without sufficient security benefits.

D. The Project Manager should consistently engage with the customers.

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ A. The Daily Scrum shouldn't exceed 15 minutes

Explanation:
The Daily Scrum, or stand-up meeting, is a brief synchronization meeting designed to last no longer than 15 minutes. This time limit keeps the meeting focused and efficient, helping the team stay aligned without unnecessary delays.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ B. Scrum prioritizes prototyping to enhance predictability and manage risks:
Scrum encourages iterative development and frequent feedback but does not explicitly prioritize prototyping. The focus is on delivering potentially shippable increments during time-boxed sprints.

❌ C. The Product Owner is accountable for the team's deliverables:
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing product value and managing the product backlog, but the entire Scrum Team collectively owns the deliverables.

❌ D. The Project Manager should consistently engage with the customers:
In Scrum, direct customer engagement is primarily the Product Owner’s responsibility, not the Project Manager’s.

5. You are designing a large-scale distributed system that requires communication between various components. Each component needs to be notified when certain events occur in other components. Which design pattern would you use to facilitate this communication in a loosely coupled manner?

A. Factory Method Pattern

B. Strategy Pattern

C. Singleton Pattern

D. Observer Pattern

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Observer Pattern

Explanation:
The Observer Pattern supports a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents (observers) are automatically notified and updated. This enables loosely coupled communication where components can subscribe to events without tight integration.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ C. Singleton Pattern:
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access, but does not facilitate inter-component communication.

❌ A. Factory Method Pattern:
Defines an interface for object creation but doesn’t address communication or notification between components.

❌ B. Strategy Pattern:
Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms selected at runtime, but isn’t designed for event notification or component communication.

B. Risk of unauthorized code execution

C. Over-reliance on COTS components

D. Delays in encryption function performance

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ B. Risk of unauthorized code execution

Explanation:
Reflection allows dynamic code evaluation and execution at runtime, which can be exploited if user-controlled inputs are executed without proper validation. This creates a vulnerability for code injection attacks, enabling attackers to run unauthorized or malicious code and bypass security controls.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ C. Over-reliance on COTS components:
This relates to vendor dependencies and is unrelated to reflection-based risks.

❌ D. Delays in encryption function performance:
Reflection does not affect cryptographic performance.

9. You’ve implemented a stored procedure in a legacy database system to log all user transactions. The log includes the start time of each transaction, the operation performed, the user who executed it, and the end time when the transaction completed. However, you've noticed that the stored procedure often fails to record the end time, leaving this field blank. What action should you take first?

A. Verify database administration settings to improve performance

B. Modify the stored procedure to remove the "End of transaction" field

C. Check the atomicity of the stored procedure

D. Enforce mandatory consistency for all database transactions

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ C. Check the atomicity of the stored procedure

Explanation:
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is fully completed or not at all. The missing end time suggests that the stored procedure might be failing partway through. Reviewing atomicity helps ensure each transaction is fully logged or, if interrupted, does not result in incomplete entries.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ D. Enforce mandatory consistency for all database transactions:
Consistency addresses accuracy across transactions but doesn’t fix incomplete logging within the procedure.

❌ B. Modify the stored procedure to remove the "End of transaction" field:
Removing the field avoids the problem instead of resolving incomplete logging.

❌ A. Verify database administration settings to improve performance:
Performance tuning is not the primary issue; the problem lies in procedural completeness.

B. Regularly hash the most critical fields

C. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

D. Set up triggers for logging changes

<details> <summary>Show answer</summary>

Correct Answer:

✅ D. Set up triggers for logging changes

Explanation:
Database triggers can automatically log changes to data, recording who made the change and when. This creates an audit trail that helps detect suspicious activity and identify the insider responsible for unauthorized modifications.

Incorrect Answers:

❌ C. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
RBAC limits who can access or modify data, reducing risk but may not identify who altered data if abuse happens within authorized roles.

❌ B. Regularly hash the most critical fields:
Hashing helps detect data tampering but does not reveal who made the changes.

❌ A. Install keyloggers on employees' devices:
Keyloggers raise serious ethical and legal concerns and violate privacy rights.
